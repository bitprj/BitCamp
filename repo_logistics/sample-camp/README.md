# Bitcamp [Camp Name]

*[**Beginner friendly** description about the camp. Should describe why and how the particular skill (ex: serverless functions) is important and provide a definition of the concept]*

> **Example:** "Have you ever heard of the cloud? It's the servers that can be accessed over the internet. This can not only be used to store your files, but also to run your own written code. Just like how you can store your files in Google Drive instead of on your computer, you can also run code in a "serverless" fashion and not on your personal machine. With serverless architecture, you're free from the worries of managing a server, which is pretty complicated. All you have to do is worry about the logic! As a student with beginning experience or advanced, mastering Functions allow you to get skills of processing bulk data, integrating systems, and building simple APIs and micro-services. These concepts can be applied *everywhere* in computing and application development."



*[Short and concise description of the project students will build as a part of the course.]*

> **Example:** "Throughout the course, students will build a complete web app with a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Azure Functions, NodeJS). The web app's input is a picture, and it analyzes the image to display emotion data."



**Prerequisites**

*[Give a quick description of what students should be familiar with before starting this camp]*

> **Example:** "Basic understanding of a programming language"



**Agenda**

*[List out in bullet points the basic structure of the camp. Split the weeks into sections.]*

> **Example:**
>
> * *Starting out:* Week 0 consists of an introductory JS project and Week 1 assists students in setting up with VSCode, a basic Azure Function, and Github.
> * *The project:* Week 2 (backend) and Week 3 (frontend) is when students begin building their "Emotion Detector"
> * Open Ended Project: Week 4 - is when students start building their final projects using serverless functions and the APIs of their choosing to build a full stack application. 



**Tools**

*[List out in bullet points the applications/tools that students will be using during this camp.]*

> **Example:**
>
> - VScode
> - Github
> - Azure Static Web Apps
> - Azure Functions
> - Microsoft Cognitive Services (Face API).
