# Week 2: [Title of Week]

*[Describe what this week will focus on, providing 3 key details.] Example: This week will focus on three topics: downloading an IDE (visual studio code), configuring and messing around with Azure, and figuring out how to use GitHub.*

### Learning Objectives

*[Should be the same `Learning Objectives` as the README.md file in the `sample-camp/` directory] That is located [here](https://github.com/emsesc/BitCamp/blob/repo-logistics/repo_logistics/sample-camp/README.md)*

### Livestream

- For the full video, look in the [video folder]().
- For the full code, look in the [code folder]().

**We'll be going over how to:**

*[Provide a brief chronological order of what will be covered in the livestream.]*

*Example:* 

*1. Installing Visual Studio Code*

*2. Creating an Azure Account*

*3. Learning the Basics of GitHub*

### Homework

*[Describe the homework students have to complete. Where is it located? What tools do they use? How many tasks?] Example: Your task is to follow a step by step guide on how to download an IDE, create an Azure account, and get started with GitHub. After that, on your own you will be completing 3 simple tasks to show your understanding of these programs.*

### :question: How will this help students?

*[Connect the livestream to the homework and demonstrate how they work together to reinforce the students' learning. Maybe the livestream is slightly different than the homework - it allows students to figure out content on their own? Does the livestream review content that will be used in the homwork?] Example: The livestream demonstrates step by step how to set up necessary resources needed to succeed in Bitcamp Serverless. It contains information that will assist them in completing the tasks for this week with these tools: an IDE, Azure, and Github.
