# üõ† Working With Github Learning Labs: Creating from an Existing Repository

## üìö **Resources**
* Github's [documentation](https://lab.github.com/docs/publishing) on using existing repositories to create Learning Labs.
* "Re-using" a forked [repository](https://lab.github.com/docs) to create a Learning Lab (ex: same thing as a pre-existing repository.
* For more information, checkout the Github Forums and specifically the "Learning Lab" section.

*As of now, the UI builder for Github Learning Lab isn' t the MOST reliable so we have decided to create Learning Labs through https://lab.github.com and through existing repositories.*

##  üìùNecessary Learning Lab Content

Within a Learning Lab there are 2 KEY files: `config.yml` and `course-details.md`, however, additionally having your markdown files and images in seperate folders is as important for your Learning Lab to actually function and have a purpose.

**It is SUPER important that you have the same format as a regular Learning Lab repository!**
 
 Creating a Learning Lab from an existing repository is important because it not only is an easy way to deploy your own learning lab from your own repository, but it gives you the opportunity to fork other users Learning Labs and test out their features (use this for *inspiration*).
## üìÅSteps to Creating from an Existing Repository

`First` We need to locate the repository we want to use to create the actual Learning Lab from. This can be a Learning Lab you created in the past or even a forked repository of another  user's Learning Lab.

`Second` After finding the repository we want to turn into a Learning Lab, head to the following link: https://lab.github.com/new. You  should see the option to create a new Learning Lab and in *small blue* font, "[already have a course repository](https://lab.github.com/Bahburs/new)".

`Third` Now you should be given a new page that lets you input a repository URL. For example,  if I had a learning lab on JavaScript under `myname/javascript-course`, I would input `javascript-course` (make sure not to put your Github username before).

`Lastly` Press the "Create" button and you should be presented with your brand new Learning Lab from the existing repository you inputted. Congrats, you're done!

---
If you don't have a Learning Lab repository and/or haven't forked another user's repository, head to https://lab.github.com/new and create a new Learning Lab. Make sure to view the other markdown files on the format and creation of a new Learning Lab  in `/learning_lab`!
