# :tent: Bit Project Bitcamp Documentation

### What's in `repo_logistics/`?

* In the `sample-camp` directory, you will find a template subdirectory for how each Bitcamp documentation should be structured.
  * This README.md file will give a brief overview of where everything is located.
  * If you need a reference to a complete Bitcamp documentation, click [here](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Serverless-Functions)
* In the `learning_lab` directory, you will find instructions to create your very own Github Learning Lab from your curriculum.

## :deciduous_tree: Documenting Bitcamp Curriculum (`sample-camp/`)

Maintaining a consistent Bitcamp Curriculum documentation throughout all Bitcamps makes it easier for open-source contributors to understand how everything is structured. This section will go over where everything is located and provide basic descriptions to clarify each directory's purpose.

**Filesystem Structure:**

* `sample-camp`
  * `week1/`
    * `homework/`
      * `code/solution/`
      * `issues/`
    * `livestream/`
      * `code/`
      * `videos/`
    * `README.md`
  * `week2/`
    * `homework/`
      * `code/solution/`
      * `issues/`
    * `livestream/`
      * `code/`
      * `videos/`
    * `README.md`
  * `week3/`
    * `homework/`
      * `code/solution/`
      * `issues/`
    * `livestream/`
      * `code/`
      * `videos/`
    * `README.md`
 * `...`
 * `README.md`

***Throughout this walkthrough, the corresponding files/directories within `sample-camp/` will be linked for your reference***

### :book: [The root README.md file](https://github.com/emsesc/BitCamp/blob/repo-logistics/repo_logistics/sample-camp/README.md)

**What is it?**

This is the general README.md file under your camp's [subdirectory](https://github.com/emsesc/BitCamp/blob/repo-logistics/repo_logistics/sample-camp). This contains a general overview of the entire camp and quick summaries of each week.

**Purpose:** This is for open-source contributors to understand what the camp's goals are and what the curriculum contains. This should NOT be as detailed as individual week descriptions. Be as clear and concise as possible.

### :file_folder: [Week Folders](https://github.com/emsesc/BitCamp/blob/repo-logistics/repo_logistics/sample-camp)

**What is it?**

These are directories within the camp [subdirectory](https://github.com/emsesc/BitCamp/blob/repo-logistics/repo_logistics/sample-camp) that organize the content by weeks. Create as many as you need accordingly to the camp's weeks.

**Purpose:** These directories each contain the week's README.md (individual week description), livestream, and homework.

### :open_file_folder: [Inside the Week Folders](https://github.com/emsesc/BitCamp/blob/repo-logistics/repo_logistics/sample-camp/week1)

**What is it?**

Inside the Week Directories, there are three components: livestream, homework, and the README.md (individual week description).

* [**`homework`**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Serverless-Functions/week1/homework): this contains the **code solution for that week's homework** and the **issues** from the Github Learning Lab

* [**`livestream`**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Serverless-Functions/week1/livestream): this contains the **code from the livestream** and the **recorded livestreams**

* [**`README.md`**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/blob/master/Serverless-Functions/week1/README.md): this is the **individual week description**, which should be differentiated from the root [README.md file](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/blob/master/Serverless-Functions/README.md)
  * **Note:** some content from the root [README.md file](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/blob/master/Serverless-Functions/README.md) is repeated in the [individual week description](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/blob/master/Serverless-Functions/week1/README.md) for clarification.
