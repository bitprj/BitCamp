## Bit Camp by Bit Project
![Bit Camp Logo](/BitCampIllustration.jpeg)
## Our Mission

The majority of students don't have resources to provide students with access to countless tech educational resources outside of the classroom. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, [Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/) makes it possible by helping students find ways to stay marketable in the competitive tech industry. 
We offer a free open source alternative called "Bit Camps," created by student developers in collaboration with industry partners. The Bit Camps' goal is to teach beginner students various tech topics, such as software engineering, game development, and data analytics. 


## Introduce Bit Camps

Our Bit Camps consist of weekly live streams (hosted by our student volunteers), assignments, office hours, and a final project.  Although mentorship and feedback are only available to students who apply and get into the boot camp, the curriculum is FREE and OPEN to all who want to learn new technologies and apply their skills to their own side projects. 

To find out more, click on the links below. Additionally, we also provide a syllabus in the readme section to better understand each curriculum.


#### 1. [**GameDev**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/GameDev)

In this 8-week Bit Camp, you will learn how to make your own video games using Unity, a standard game development platform in the industry. You will start off creating a basic game, and then advance to include audio design and user interface.

#### 2. [**Javascript**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Javascript)

In this 4-week Bit Camp, co-hosted by Twilio, students will learn the JavaScript programming language by navigating through TwilioQuest, an educational video game created by Twilio. Students will be introduced to using the terminal, setting up a local development environment, and basic programming concepts throughout the course.

#### 3. [**NoSQL**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/NoSQL)

This 8-week camp will be focusing on Atlas, which allows MongoDB to be developed and deployed in the cloud. Students will begin with the basics, setting up a database and then branching out to discover ways to analyze, filter, and create data. The last few weeks of camp consist of time to develop apply their newfound expertise and create a Web App with a MongoDB backend.

#### 4. [**Serverless-Functions**](https://lab.github.com/bitprj/creating-an-emotion-reader-with-azure-(face-api-and-http-triggers)/)

In this 8-week Bit Camp, co-hosted by Microsoft, you will learn about serverless architecture and functions, and why they are useful. You will utilize Microsoft Azure serverless functions, JavaScript, and external APIs to build and deploy your own app from end to end.

#### 5. [**Slack-Apps**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Slack-Apps)

In this 6-week Bit Camp co-hosted by Slack, students will be introduced to the Slack Platform and learn how to create Slack apps using Bolt for JavaScript. After setting up a basic Slack app, students will continue to add new features each week, including implementing third-party APIs and making use of Webhooks.
