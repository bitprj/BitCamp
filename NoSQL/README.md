# Bitcamp NoSQL :leaves:

Data is all around us and knowing how to use and manipulate databases is an increasingly important skill in today's technological world. Think about the amount of data stored and retrieved everyday: what can you do with this information, and how can you accomplish that? NoSQL platforms are ideal to search, create, and analyze data and make applications with databases.

Throughout the course, students will build a complete web app with a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (MongoDB Database, Netlify). The web app consists of endpoints that allow users to create and edit surveys and submit and analyze responses.

**Prerequisites**

Basic understanding of a programming language (preferrably JavaScript)

**Agenda**

* Week 1 gets students familiar with the tools needed to finish this project and introduces them to NoSQL Databases.
* Weeks 2 - 4 is when students start on their project for this course: a web application similar to Google Forms.

**Tools**

- Netlify
- MongoDB Atlas
- Postman
- Github
- VSCode
