# Bitcamp NoSQL :leaves:

Data is all around us and knowing how to use and manipulate databases is an increasingly important skill in today's technological world. NoSQL platforms are ideal to search, create, and analyze data and make applications with databases.

## The Goal ðŸ¥…
**Who?** Built with the audience of college and high school students that have minimal to advanced coding experience in mind. Most do not have experience with NoSQL databases and deploying web applications.

**What?** Concise and interactive Github Learning Lab that introduces and develops skills related to NoSQL databases with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

**How?** Students gain experience through building a complete web app with a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, Atlas Realms) and backend (MongoDB, Azure Services, NodeJS). The application utilizes machine learning, an external API, and NoSQL databases to recommend products to users based off of a picture. Authentication is used to incorporate the database, which stores a history of recommendations with a corresponding user.

**When?** 
* *Starting out:* Week 1 will ease students into the course by introducing them to MongoDB Compass and basic concepts related to NoSQL databases. They will also set up necessary tools (GitHub and Git Bash).
* *The project:* Weeks 2 through 4 will focus on building the Product Recommendation Engine, walking through 3 basic steps: coding the backend Azure Function, deploying the frontend on Atlas Realms, and finally implementing the MongoDB database and authentication.

**Where?** Tools used include Github, Git Bash, Atlas Realms, Azure Services, and MongoDB (Compass) Databases.

### Project Description
4-week course on using MongoDB, Azure Services, Atlas Realms, and Deploying a Webapp.

### **Week 1**
***

ðŸ“š **Summary**

Students are able to navigate [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) and understand how GitHub/Git Bash can be used effectively for developing applications after this week. They will experiment with and create sample datasets that reinforce understanding of how NoSQL databases store information and are structured.

**Learning Objectives**
* How to Use GitHub (commits, pull requests, etc.) and Git Bash
* MongoDB Compass: access and create your databases
* Basic MongoDB terminology
* The basics of JSON
