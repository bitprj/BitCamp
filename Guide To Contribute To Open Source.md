# Beginners Guide To Contribute To Open Source
What is ************Open Source************: Open source is anything that is created by person which could be a "Software" Or "Code" that is publicly accessible to users like ****you****. Doing this will allow you to "Modify" "Alter" "Change" The way you see fit. 

What is the point of ************Open Source************: This allows users to take peices of that "Software" or "Code" and change it for their own liking, which then if the main creators believes that the "Software" Or "Code" is a greater than the oringal creation then it can be integrate into a bigger project or changed from the orginal creation.    




## Steps on how to contribute to a open source Repositories 

1. When wanting to contribute to open source you will need to fork a repository. A fork is how you copy and paste what ever files that are accessible to you. To fork you will need to goto the bit project and click the fork on the top right of the page. Once you do that it will copy the files to your repository

2. You will then need to click on your profile link on the top right of the page and click my Repository once there youâ€™ll see a copy version of bit project.

3. Once in your own Repository you can then edit, download, and upload anything you want for your own liking.

4. Once you feel that you have edited a file to your liking you would scroll down to "Commit Changes" And you would have two options, one "Commit directly to the **master** branch." Or "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." Sounds difficult right? Well its not, What it means is you can either save all your edits into the fork or (copy) version of the repo you created. Or create a new branch and start a pull request which tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. But from our suggestions if you're working on multiple files it would be best to commit directly into your own fork before creating a pull request.

5. If you did click "Commit directly to the master branch." And you have feel like you finished editing everything in your repository it is now time to do a PR (Pull Request) Which is going to alert people about the changes you have commited and see if it would be ready to be pushed back onto the main repo. You're going to click Pull Request on the top left and then click New Pull Request.

6. Once you click New Pull Request you're going to see a [Title] Box and a [Description] Box. Within your Title you want to make sure its descriptive and for the Description you want to be sure to explain on what this Pull Request is about.

7. After you completed both the box you're going to include an issue if the pullrequest does have an issue? A github issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. Once you included everything you are going to click the drop down arrow on the green button and select "Create draft pull request" When you create a Draft Pull Request, it cannot be merged until it is marked as ready for review.

8. After that just click the wonderful green button with the words "Draft Pull Request" and it'll be sent to the orginal repository.

## What Are Markdown?
Markdown format allows users to style plain text on a website like formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists which are just a few of things we can do with markdown. If you click the "Raw" Button on the top right you can see how I use Markdown within this documentation.
