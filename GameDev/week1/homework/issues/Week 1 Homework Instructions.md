## Bitcamp Game Development - Week 1 Homework


For this week, youâ€™ll be putting together a custom Unity editor layout. A layout is an arrangement of different unity tabs in the unity editor. This week during the live session, you learned about what each of these tabs does, and when you might want to access them. Based on what you know, your task this week is to come up with your own custom editor layout, create it, and save it for future use. Try this on your own first, but if you need directions on how to change and save your layout, follow the instructions here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomizingYourWorkspace.html


Good luck!
