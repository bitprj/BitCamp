Now, what I’d like for you to do this week is to find some sound assets of your own, either using the websites I’ve shown you, some other source, or even your own recording.

- Find one background music track
- Find one jumping sound effect
- Find one crashing sound effect
- Add each file to the project and have them replace the default sounds
- Be aware of every audio's licensing!

For further mastery of audio:

- One issue with the game is that the music keeps playing when the game ends. How can you use Audio Source’s Stop() method to cut the music off at the right time?
- How about a fade effect instead, so the cut isn’t so sudden? We need to adjust both the Audio Source’s volume and pitch over time to make this work.
