Bitcamp Game Development - Week 2 Homework

For this week’s homework, we’ll be adding assets to our game and writing basic scripts in C#.

Your task is to create a road race! To do this, you’ll have to start from the project we installed in the first week (the one with the cars and the road). Try to do these steps on your own first, but if you need a little guidance, check the unity C# documentation or the recording from this week’s live session.

Your tasks:
1. Add three (or more) cars of your choosing to the scene. 
2. Create a C# script called “CarMovement”
3. In your script, create a public variable called “velocity”
4. On each update step, make your car move forward so that the car moves at “velocity” meters per second. (you might need to use Time.deltaTime here)
5. Attach the script to each of the cars, and give them each a different speed without changing the script (hint: use your public variable!)
6. Run the game and watch your cars race!

If you run into trouble while trying to complete these steps, don’t be afraid to google your problem! No wrong answers here, there are many ways to do this (the one we covered in the live session works well).
