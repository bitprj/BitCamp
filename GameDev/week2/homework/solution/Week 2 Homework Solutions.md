# BitCamp Game Development Week 2 Homework Solutions

To complete this week’s homework, follow these steps. Try it on your own before looking at this sheet!

1. Add Cars by navigating to the “Project” tab, going into Assets/Course Libraries/Vehicles and dragging in the cars to the scene
2. Create the script by navigating to Assets, then right clicking and going to Create->C# Script
3. Give your script a name and open it. 
4. CarScript.cs is one way to complete the script. This is not the only way to do this, if yours works then it’s correct! 
5. Save your script (this is important!), then attach your script to each car by clicking on the car, then dragging the script from the project tab to the “Add Component” button on the inspector tab while inspecting the game object, repeating this process for each car.
6. If done right, you should be able to change the velocity from inside the editor by accessing the script component you attached in the inspector.
7. Give all three cars different speeds then hit the play button and watch the race!
