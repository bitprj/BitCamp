This week we will finish the game we started last week by adding a main menu with buttons that control the difficulty. This main menu will be our third and final scene, and we will change some of last weeks code to allow all three scenes to work together. By the end of this portion of today's lesson, we will have a main menu with buttons that control the spawn rate of crates, the game itself with dynamic score text, and a game over screen with a button that restarts the game at the previiously selected difficulty. 

Once we finish our Crates game, we will move on to another example to showcase more UI elements. More specifically, we will show an inventory system that uses grids, panels, and images. This section will also go into how to enable and disable game objects as a quick and easy way hiding items without completely removing them. Starter code is given in the same folder as this file. Please note that the Inventory system is currently in Unity version 2020.1. Playing the starter code you are able to move around a field with wasd, and there are some items in the field. By the end of today's session, you will be able to press i to pull up your inventory menu that shows all the items you've picked up.
