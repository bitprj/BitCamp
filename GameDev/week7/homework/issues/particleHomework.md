One of the best skills you can have as a game developer is being able to follow online tutorials! Following someone else’s guidance on how to design particle systems is relatively straightforward, and might inspire you to create your own particle “recipes”.

The assignment this week is to either watch one of these tutorials and replicate the desired effect, or reverse-engineer any of Unity’s default particle systems and make something new of it. Have fun with your new effects!
