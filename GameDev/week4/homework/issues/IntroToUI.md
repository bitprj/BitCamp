This week we will be providing an introduction to user interface, or UI, using a practical example. We will learn how to create basic UI elements such as text and buttons. This includes text that changes throughout the course of our running game and a working restart button. We will also give an example of working with multiple scenes by making a game over screen. 

Then we add a main menu with buttons that control the difficulty. This main menu will be our third and final scene, and we will change some of last weeks code to allow all three scenes to work together. By the end of this portion of today's lesson, we will have a main menu with buttons that control the spawn rate of crates, the game itself with dynamic score text, and a game over screen with a button that restarts the game at the previiously selected difficulty.
