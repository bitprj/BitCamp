# Student Experience

Instructors are responsible for ensuring that students in the Mentorship Program have the best experience possible. For this, we require each Camp's instructors to:

- Collect progress reports and feedback on a weekly basis
- Conduct one virtual video call 1:1 meeting mid-way through the Camp

The purpose of this is to ensure that the instructors are fully aware of any struggles that the students are facing so that they can tailor the experience accordingly.

# Student Orientation

### Meeting the Students

- Scribble.io for 15-20 mins
- Introductions when you get bored:
    - Name
    - Education Stuff
    - Two truths & a lie (game)
- This is the time to *socialize* and get comfy

### Introducing Yourselves

- Depth is valuable for the students
    - Shows them that you’re more than just a person who wrote the curriculum + you care about their experience
    - Helps them open up to you later as well

- + Depth:
    - Background & interests?
    - What brought you into tech?
    - What has your experience with Bit Camp been like?

### Introducing the Curriculum
