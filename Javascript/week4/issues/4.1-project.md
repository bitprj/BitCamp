### :rocket: Project!

#### :tada: Congratulations! :tada: You’ve reached the final week of Camp Twilio. Now let’s put your experience from time traveling :alarm_clock: and communicating with aliens :alien: to the ultimate test.

For your final project, you have complete :sparkles:creative freedom:sparkles: to essentially create whatever your heart’s desire is—with a few catches. To ensure that you’ve learned a lesson from your adventure through the cosmos, there are a few concepts you need to make sure you include in your creation.

* :arrow_right: **Incorporate JavaScript arrays, loops, conditional statements, and recursion!**
* :arrow_right: **Keep your inputs and outputs based in the console like we’ve been doing these past 3 weeks.**

If you’re having trouble brainstorming :brain: the perfect project idea, take a look at these examples and talk with your mentors. Don’t be afraid to reach out to them as well if you have questions about how to integrate those concepts.
