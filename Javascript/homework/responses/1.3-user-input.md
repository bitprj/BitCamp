## Task 3: Using JavaScript to read user input

#### Now that we've set up the form, we'll use JavaScript to grab the user's input for us to use in our code.

Outside of the form, but still in the body, open the `script` tag with the `type` attribute set to `"text/javascript"`. To open the script tag you would type <script type="">  Inside here, define a function to print the user's selection from the timezone form.  You can do this by looping through the radio buttons and seeing if the `checked` attribute is true.

Once you find the checked radio button, save it to a variable.  Next, use `document.getElementById().innerHTML` and place the id of the div you defined below the submit button in the parentheses.  Set this line equal to the variable holding the checked radio button to print it onto your webpage.  For example, I set my div's id to `"result"` and named my variable `output` and my code looked like this:

`document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = output;`

Finally, you'll want to scroll up to your submit button and add the `onclick` attribute to the `button` tag and set it equal to the name of the function you just defined so that the computer knows to call this function when the submit button is clicked.  My function was named `ValidateForm` and my button tag looks like this:

`<button type="button" value="Submit" onclick="ValidateForm()"> Submit </button>`

Now, your page should print out the value of whichever item the user has selected when they click the submit button.

#### Open a pull request for your code

Just as you did for your previous tasks, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  As a reminder my GitHub username is `danzelo1` so my branch name for week 1's third task (this assignment) would be `danzelo1-1-3`.

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  When creating this request, be sure to title it appropriately in accordance with your changes, and include any specific details in your comments.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (so this week would be week 1). A new comment should have appeared for your next task. This is where you'll find the instructions for task 4.
