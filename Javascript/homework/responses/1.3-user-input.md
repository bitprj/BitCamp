## Task 3: Using JavaScript to read user input

#### Now that we've set up the form, we'll use JavaScript to grab the user's input for us to use in our code.

Outside of the form, but still in the body, open the `script` tag with its `type` property set to `"text/javascript"`.   This will let the computer know to read the content inside of this tag as JavaScript, not HTML.

- The script tag works like any other tag, so to open it you would type `<script type="">`  

- It's imperative that every line of code you write in this line, except for lines with curly braces, is followed with a semicolon

- Inside here, define a function to print the user's selection from the timezone form.  

  - To define a function, type `function` followed by the name of your function, which must be unique and must be followed by parentheses and curly braces, like this:

    ```{js}
    function readForm(){
      //the content of your function will go here
    }
    ```

  - Inside of the curly braces is where you will write all of your code for this function

  - In your function, define two variables - you can do this using the `var` keyword.

    `var myVariable = value;`

    - Your first variable will be an array to hold all of the radio buttons.  You can do this by setting your variable equal to `document.getElementsByName("[name property value for the timezone buttons]")`.  To learn more about arrays, visit [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) - w3schools is a really helpful resource that covers all the basics of any language.
      - For example, one of my input fields looks like this: `<input type="radio" id="est" name="tz" value="est">` and my variable looks like this: `var radioButtons = document.getElementsByName("tz");`
      - This line of code references the HTML page by using the `document` object and gathering all elements with the same value for the HTML `name` property.
    - Your second variable will hold the selected radio button's `value` - since the `value` property on the input field for the radio button is what made each button unique
      - Since we don't know the selected button yet, we can just set it to a random element's value
      - The variable we made for the radio buttons is an indexable array - meaning to access an element we can use the name of the array and square brackets
        - If you named your first variable `radioButtons` like I did, you could grab the value of the first element of your array using `radioButtons[0].value` since we start counting at 0 in computer science

  - Now that these variables are initialized, we'll cycle through the array holding all of the buttons and see which one is selected.

    - First, let's make a for loop - this is when we define a task to be completed a set number of times.  It's definition looks like this:

      ```{javascript}
      for (var i = 0; i < radioButtons.length; i++){
        //tasks go here
      }
      ```

     where `i` is a variable that only exists for the scope of the for loop.  

    - In this case, `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 (`i++`) with every iteration of the loop until the loop reaches the length of the `radioButtons` array - 1 (`i < radioButtons.length`).  

    - For each iteration of the loop, the tasks inside the curly braces are completed.

    - Once `i` reaches the value set in the second portion of the for loops definition (`i < radioButtons.length`), the loop breaks and the compiler moves onto the code outside of the curly brackets.

    - Now, to check if the button is selected, we will use an if statement.  These check a condition and return a boolean - true or false - you can learn more about if statements [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp).  We can check the `checked` condition on each button using an if statement like this:

      ```{javascript}
      if (radioButtons[i].checked == true){
        //actions go here
      }
      ```

    - Since we want to check every radio button to see if it's been checked, place this if statment inside of your for loop.

    - Back to the if statement, if the `checked` property is true, this means we've found the selected timezone.  So, inside of this if statement, save the value of the radio button at the current index (`radioButton[i].value`) to the second variable that you defined earlier.

Now, you've found and saved the timezone selected by the user!

- Next, use `document.getElementById().innerHTML`  

  - Place the id of the div you defined below the submit button in the parentheses.  

  - Set this line equal to the variable holding the checked radio button to print it onto your webpage.  
    - For example, I set my div's id to `"result"` and named my variable `output` and my code looked like this:`document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = output;`

Finally, you'll want to scroll up to your submit button 

- Add the `onclick` property to the `button` tag and set it equal to the name of the function you just defined
  - This will let the computer know to call this function when the submit button is clicked.  
  - My function was named `ValidateForm` and my button tag looks like this:`<button type="button" value="Submit" onclick="ValidateForm()"> Submit </button>`

Now, your page should print out the value of whichever item the user has selected when they click the submit button, like so:

#### Open a pull request for your code

Just as you did for your previous tasks, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  As a reminder my GitHub username is `danzelo1` so my branch name for week 1's third task (this assignment) would be `danzelo1-1-3`.

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  When creating this request, be sure to title it appropriately in accordance with your changes, and include any specific details in your comments.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (so this week would be week 1). A new comment should have appeared for your next task. This is where you'll find the instructions for task 4.
