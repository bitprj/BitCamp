## Task 3: Creating your clock

#### For the third task, we're going to begin designing a digital clock using some basic styling techniques.

After you're satisfied with the body of your page, define a selector that styles elements in the `clock` class.

- Set a width and a height for the box that's going to hold your time  
- Add a background and a solid border using colors different from the screen's background so you can see what the box will look like.
  - Use the `background-color` and `border` attributes for these items respectively

- Set your `display` to `flex` 
- Center your text using `align-items` and `justify-content` 

You need to do this again because these attributes in the body only centered the box on your page; repeating the two bullets above in the clock section will center your text within the box.

You may also want to adjust the margins of your clock so that theres some space between the box and the form - I simply adjusted the left margin of my clock.

You can add as many bells and whistles to this clock that you please.  I increased the font-size here and added a box-shadow to add some depth to my clock.

The first number in each line represents the x-offset which is the horizontal distance from which you want the object to appear.  The second number is the y-offset - the vertical distance from which the box will appear.  The third number is the blur radius - a larger blur radius will create a bigger shadow and vice versa. 

Lastly is the color.  I used the `rgba()` tool to define my color.  The first 3 numbers represent the amount of red, green, and blue in the color, respectively. The fourth number is the opacity on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being complete transparency and 1 being fully opaque.

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week. A new comment should have appeared for your next task where you'll find the instructions for task 4.
