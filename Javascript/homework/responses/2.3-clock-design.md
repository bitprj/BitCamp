## Task 3: Creating your clock

#### For the third task, we're going to begin designing a digital clock using some basic styling techniques.

After you're satisfied with the body of your page, you'll move on to designing your clock.

1. Define a selector that styles elements in the `clock` class. 
   - This selector will style the `div` we created in the last assignment that prints the time on your screen.  
   - If this `div` tag only has an `id` property, be sure to go back to your HTML file and add a `class` attribute set to `"clock"`.

Within your `.clock` selector:

2. Set the `width` to `500px` and `height` to `200px`. This will define the rectangle in which the time is printed.
3. Add a **background** and a **solid border** using colors different from the screen's background so you can see what the box will look like.
   - Use the `background-color` and `border` attributes for these items respectively

4. Set the `display` to `flex` 
5. Center the text using `align-items` and `justify-content` 
6. You may also want to **adjust the margins** of your clock so that theres some space between the box and the form - I simply adjusted the left margin of my clock.

This is what my code looks like after these steps:

```css
.clock{
  	width: 500px;
    height: 200px;
    font-size: 90px;
    background: #102;
    border: 20px solid black;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
		margin-left: 50px;
}
```

Now, you may notice that my border appears slightly different than yours- this is because I used the CSS box-shadow tool to create some depth to my clock and add additional borders. This effect is in no way required, but if you'd like to learn more about it, click below!

The first number in each line represents the x-offset which is the horizontal distance from which you want the object to appear. The second number is the y-offset - the vertical distance from which the box will appear. The third number is the blur radius - a larger blur radius will create a bigger shadow and vice versa.

Lastly is the color. I used the rgba() tool to define my color. The first 3 numbers represent the amount of red, green, and blue in the color, respectively. The fourth number is the opacity on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being complete transparency and 1 being fully opaque.

This tool can be very intimidating so I suggest using a box-shadow generator, such as [this one](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) and playing around with the options so that you can understand what's going on a little better and simply copy the code generated.

#### Task 3 Checklist:

- [ ] A clock class selector
- [ ] Custom colors and fonts for your clock
- [ ] The time centered on your "digital clock"

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week. A new comment should have appeared for your next task where you'll find the instructions for task 4.
