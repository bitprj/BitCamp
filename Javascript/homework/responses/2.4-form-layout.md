## Task 4: Styling your buttons 

#### Now that you've styled your text and your clock, now's time to make any changes to your radio buttons that you'd like.

Lastly, you're going to style the labels and buttons used for your timezone selector.

Define a selector that targets your timezone elements. 

1. Make sure that your radio buttons and labels are grouped in some way.  
   - I recommend surrounding these elements with a `div` with its `class` property set to `"timezone"`.  
2. Then define a selector in your CSS file that targets these elements, like so:

![timezone-selector-2-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32557138/106408404-5eee6900-640c-11eb-9960-6c4581bf1cf0.png)

If you're already satisfied with how your page looks because of how you styled the body, then this part is unnecessary, but I recommend you do some styling here to get a better hang of CSS attributes.

3. You can change the `font-family`, or the `font-size`, or even the `font-color` - use your creativitity with this task.

This is what my page looks like after this step:

#### Task 4 Checklist:
- [ ] A timezone selector
- [ ] Customization of timezone elements (optional)

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. This is the last task for week 2, so you're all done!
