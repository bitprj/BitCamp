## Task 1: Create a new page with an analog and a digital clock

#### Your final assignment is going to merge everything you've created so far onto a single webpage, and allow the user to choose between a digital clock and analog clock. This first task will help you get all of your code in one place.

1. Copy your files from last week into your week 4 folder.  
2. Add a div tag below your clock div (below the `</div>` tied to `<div class="clock">` ) with its `class` attribute set to `"digital"` and `id` attribute set to `"digital clock"` 
   - The code should looks like this:`<div class="digital" id="digital clock"></div>`.

3. Go to your week 2 files and copy the function you wrote for your digital clock in week 2 to show the time.  

4. Paste the contents of this function into the function that sets the analog clock in your JavaScript file

   - This will ensure both clocks are set with a single function call.

   - I had to change one line of my code in my JavaScript file from

     `document.getElementById("clock").innerText = time;`

     to

     `document.getElementById("digital clock").innerText = time;`

     because the new `div` object I created to show the time has `id` = `"digital clock"` as stated in step 2.

   - Also be sure to rename any repeating variables if necessary to get the function working.  

After making these changes, your page should look something like this:![start-4-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32557138/106409010-9a3d6780-640d-11eb-8f3d-3e80cd85dee5.png)

5. Add a selector in your css file that selects the `"digital"` class like so:

   `.digital {}` 

You may choose to style your digital clock differently this time, but if not, feel free to copy the code from week 2's CSS file in the `.clock` section and paste it into your `.digital` section.

Your page should now look something like this:

Feel free to size down the digital clock so that it doesn't mess up your layout when you resize your screen. You can do this by changing the `height` and `width` elements in the `clock` and `digital` selectors. However, keep in mind that only one of these items will appear on the screen at a time in your final product.

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task. For example, my username is `danzelo1` so my branch would be called `danzelo1-4-1` for this task.

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  Be sure to title and comment your pull request appropriately.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (week 4). A new comment should have appeared for your next task where you'll find the instructions for task 2.
