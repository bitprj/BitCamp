## Task 3: Adding numbers to your clock

#### We'll use HTML and CSS in this step to print numbers on your clock and get them ready for positioning.

Next, we need to set up the numbers on our clock. 

- Go back to the HTML document and define divs for numbers 1-12 inside the clock div tags. 
  - Name the classes for these divs "number number[digit]" so for the first digit, the tag would look like: 

    â€‹		`<div class="number number1">1</div>`

- Repeat this for numbers 2-12.

Next, open up your `style.css` file and define a selector `.clock .number` - this will target all target all divs with a class starting with `"number"` within a div with a `"clock"` class, a.k.a. all of the divs we just made for our numbers on the clock.

Here, you'll want to customize the appearance of the numbers on your clock. 

- Set the `position` to `absolute` so that the numbers are anchored to the clock.  
- Set the `width` and `height` to 100%. 

The method we're going to use to get the numbers in the correct position will involve us making a square around each number that we will later rotate.  Setting the height and width to 100% will ensure that this square is always the same size as the clock background.

*Tip: You may want to add a border inside the `.clock .number` CSS section to help you better visualize what's going on in these next steps.*

- Set the `text-align` to `center` 

Now, the numbers will stay centered at the top of the clock, no matter the clock's size. You may also want to change the font family or size here, as well as the text color.

At this point your clock should look something like this:

You'll notice that the numbers overlap in one spot and you can't read them.  In the next step we'll use rotation tools to change the positioning of each digit on the clock.

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task. 

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  Be sure to title and comment your pull request appropriately.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (week 3). A new comment should have appeared for your next task where you'll find the instructions for task 4.
