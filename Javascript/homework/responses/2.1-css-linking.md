## Task 1: Linking your CSS file

#### How to begin a CSS file and link it to your HTML file.

This week, we're going to take the HTML and JavaScript code we wrote last week and style our page using CSS to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

First, let's create a new folder to hold your files.  

1. Create a new folder called week 2 within your orginal directory. You should now have two folders called "Week 1" and "Week 2"

2. Copy your index.html file from week 1 and paste it in your week 2 homework folder.

3. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.  You can do this by clicking "Open folder..." on VSC's "Welcome" page and selecting your path.

Once you have Visual Studio Code open, you can style your webpage.

First we must link a CSS file to our HTML file.  

4. Add a `link` tag inside the head of your html file

5. Set the `rel` attribute of the `link` tag to `"stylesheet"`, and its `href` attribute to `"style.css"`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"
```

</p>
</details>

6. Create a new file in your week 2 folder called `style.css`. 
   - It's important that your file name matches the one you typed in your link tag's `href` attribute in your HTML file, as this will be what links your two files.

#### Task 1 Checklist:
- [ ] Reference (href) to "styles.css" in your HTML file
- [ ] Created a new file called "style.css"

#### Open a pull request for your code

Just as you did for your previous tasks, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  For example, my GitHub username is `danzelo1` so my branch name for week 2's first task (this assignment) would be `danzelo1-2-1`.

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  When creating this request, be sure to title it appropriately in accordance with your changes, and include any specific details in your comments.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (so this week would be week 2). A new comment should have appeared for your next task. This is where you'll find the instructions for task 2.
