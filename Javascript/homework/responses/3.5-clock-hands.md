## Task 5: Designing the hands of your clock

#### We'll go over some more CSS tricks in this step to get the hands of your clock in position for time-telling.

Within your clock div you're going to include three more divsions - these will represent the hands on our clock.  

1. For each div, set the class to "hand [type of hand]" and set the data-* attribute to `data-[type of hand]-hand`.  

   - For example, the div tag for the hour hand would look like:

   ​	`<div class="hand hour" data-hour-hand></div>`

2. Repeat this for the minute hand and the second hand.

Though this div-defining process seems complicated, it will greatly simplify things when we design our clock hands in the CSS file.

We'll want all three of our hands to have some similar attributes, so in your css file, 

3. Define a selector for all items within the clock class with "hand" in their class.  
   - The definition of this field will be similar to the way we defined the first number section in the last task, so your code should look like this:

   ​		`.clock .hand { }`

4. Inside of this selector, set the `bottom` and `left` attributes to `50%` 
   - This places the hands at the center of the clock.  

5. Set `position` to `absolute` 
   - This anchors the hands to the clock.

We'll change this later, but just so you get an idea of what we're doing, 

6. Set your `height` and `width` to `40%` (this is 40% the heigh of the clock) and `10px` respectively and your `background-color` to `black`.  

This is how my clock looks at this point in the code:

![hands-3-5-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32557138/106408826-39159400-640d-11eb-9805-743f857135ac.png)

As you can see, the hand is slightly off center, which is the same issue we had earlier with the circle in the center of the clock.  Since we just want to move the hand to the left, we'll use the same trick as we did earlier, but this time the y-coordinate in the translate function will be 0.

7. Still in the hand selector, set `transform` to `translate(-50%, 0)`
8. Add a thin (1px) white border around the hands 
   - This will make the hands easier to see when they're overlapping

9. Finally, round the edges of the hands by setting the `border-top-left-radius` and `border-top-right-radius` attributes to `10px`.

Now, your clock should look like this:

In your HTML file:

```html
<div class="hand hour" data-hour-hand></div>
<div class="hand minute" data-minute-hand></div>
<div class="hand second" data-second-hand></div>
```

In your CSS file:

```css
.clock .hand{
    bottom: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    position: absolute;
    height: 40%;
    width: 10px;
    background-color: black;
    transform: translate(-50%, 0);
    border: 1px solid white;
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
}
```

</p>

Now, let's style each hand to be unique.  

10. To select the second hand, we'll define a selector:

    `.clock .hand.second{ }`

    - Make sure to leave no space between `.hand` and `.second`, as this will be crucial to your definition.  

11. Repeat step 10 for the minute hand and the hour hand.

In each of these selectors, 

12. Customize the hands so that the **seconds** hand is the **longest and thinnest**, and the **hour** hand is **shortest and widest**

13. Override the current `background-color` attribute for the seconds hand by setting it to `red` in the `.clock .hand.second` block.

14. Set the second hand's `z-index` attribute to 12
    - This makes sure that the second hand is always on top of the others

Similarly, we'll want the hour hand to always be on the bottom and the minute hand in the middle, 

15. Set hour hand and minute hand's `z-index` attributes to 10 and 11 respectively 

We'll also want the small circle in the center of the clock to always be on top of all of the hands to hide the overlap. 

16. Set the `z-index` in `clock::after` to 100.  

This attribute defines the order in which items will appear on the z-axis, so items with a higher z-index will appear to sit on top of items with a lower z-index.

Now, your clock should look something like this:

![hands-3-5-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32557138/106408862-4a5ea080-640d-11eb-8489-15db06b7e757.png)

```css
.clock .hand.second{
    height: 45%;
    width: 3px;
    background-color: red;
    z-index: 12;
}
.clock .hand.minute{
    height: 40%;
    width: 7px;
    background-color: black;
    z-index: 11;
}
.clock .hand.hour{
    height: 35%;
    width: 11px;
    background-color: black;
    z-index: 10;
}
```

Now that we have all of the styling done for the clock, it's time to get the hands moving!

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task. 

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  Be sure to title and comment your pull request appropriately.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (week 3). A new comment should have appeared for your next task where you'll find the instructions for task 6.
