## Task 4: Printing the time with JS

#### In this task, we'll show you how to print your local machine's time onto your webpage using some basic JS tools.

Next, we will print the time on your local machine onto the webpage with a simple JavaScript function.

First, define a new function inside your `script` tag, but outside of the function you just wrote for finding the selected radio button.  

- Define a new variable and set it equal to `new Date()`.  This will grab the current date and time from your local machine.

Next, create variables for the current hour, minute, and second using the respective `Date` functions.  

- Use your `Date()` object to define each of these variables.  For example, I named my `Date()` object `day` and I declared my `hour` variable using the built-in `getHours()` function like this:

  `var hour = day.getHours();`

- You may also want to define a session variable that keeps track of whether your clock is showing "AM" or "PM" - you can do this using a few simple conditionals (if statements) and some math with the hours variable.

Once you've defined your time variables, define a new variable to concatenate the hour, minute, and second variables, each separated by a colon (you can also add your session variable here). This will make the time show up in `hour:minute:second` format on your webpage.

- Strings can be concatenated in JS using `+`

- JavaScript is also designed to handle type conversion, so you can concatenate any type of object to create a string to print.

- Your variable should look like:

  `var time = hour + ":" + minute + ":" + second + session`

We'll want our clock to be updated every second, so, at the bottom of the function, call the `setTimeout()` function with the name of your clock function and `1000` as parameters.  

- This will call your function every 1000 ms (or 1 second) that your page is running.

Lastly, to print your clock, add a break and a div tag outside of your form tags.  

- Give this element a unique tag.  

Now, scroll back down to your JavaScript clock function 

- Use the document's `getElementById()` function to print your time variable, just as you did to print the form result in your previous function.

Now, you should have a working digital clock and a form that prints the item selected!

P.S. Don't forget call your clock function once at the bottom of your script!

#### Open a pull request for your code

Just as you did for your previous tasks, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  As a reminder my GitHub username is `danzelo1` so my branch name for week 1's fourth task (this assignment) would be `danzelo1-1-4`.

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  When creating this request, be sure to title it appropriately in accordance with your changes, and include any specific details in your comments.

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week (so this week would be week 1). A new comment should have appeared for your next task. This is where you'll find the instructions for task 5.
