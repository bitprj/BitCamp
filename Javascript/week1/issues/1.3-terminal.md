### Basic Terminal Commands

**Shortcuts:**
* `.` : current directory
* `..` : previous directory
* `~` : home directory

**Directory (folder):**
* `pwd` : print current directory (if you're lost, or need the full path to the current directory you're in)
* `ls` : list everything in current directory (super useful to know which files/folders you can currently access)
* `ls [directory path]` : list everything in current [directory path]
* `cd [directory path]` : change directory to [directory path] 
  * `cd /home/users/Shreya/Documents/terminal.md`
  * `cd .` : change directory to current directory (doesn't really do much)
  * `cd ..` : change directory to previous directory (useful)
  * `cd ../some_folder_name` : change directory to some_folder_name directory in previous directory (sort of like going back one and into another folder)
  * `cd .` : change directory to home directory

**Opening files (in terminal, you don't need this if you're using GitHub desktop)**  
In file:
* `vi` : open file
* `[ECS] -> *+w+q` : save file
* more useful commands: https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html

**Running a program**
* `./[program_name.extension]` [any other expected arguments]
  * `./sumarray.js` (week 2)
  * `./romanint.js 78` (week 3)
