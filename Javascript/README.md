# Bitcamp JavaScript :rocket: 

JavaScript is an extremely useful tool for user interface (UI) design that allows the programmer to build interactive webpages.  Some of the most essential items for a website's success are ease of navigation and an appealing design, thus making mastery of JavaScript a must for aspiring designers.

## The Goal ü•Ö

**Who?**  The material in this program is simplified so that those with minimal experience in computer science can try their hand at web design. This bootcamp was mainly designed for high school and college students, but aspiring coders of all ages are welcomed. Our instructors have an extensive background in coding, but are not experts with JavaScript.

**What?** Concise and interactive Github Learning Lab that introduces and develops skills related to JavaScript with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/quest).

**How?** Students will get experience with JavaScript, learning the basics as well as some advanced topics by completing assignments every week. In the end, students will use the knowledge theyve gained from TwilioQuest, a PC roleplaying game, to build a game of their choosing. 

**When?** 

* *Starting out:* Weeks 1 and 2 will help you produce simple JavaScript programs to help you get acclimated with all different aspects of the language.
* *The project:* In week 3, we will go over more advanced topics like recursion and making graphics in JS. In the fourth and final week, you will use all of your newly-acquired skills to build a game in TwilioQuest.

**Where?** Tools used include Github, JavaScript, Linux/OS Terminal, and TwilioQuest.

### Project Description

4-week course on using Javascript and Twilio.

### ‚ùó Prerequisites for BitCamp JavaScript (Week 0)

The purpose of Week 0 is to **review or teach** skills required for success with the curriculum. Because this is an introductory course, we just ask that students familiarize themselves with the material by checking out the [JavaScript website](https://www.javascript.com) and reading up on [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest).

### **Week 1**

***

üìö **Summary**

Students will **learn about and set up tools** needed for the completion of the "FizzBuzz" project. This means going over creating a new JS file, using GitHub, and navigating/compiling your files using the Terminal.

**Learning Objectives**

- Creating a JS file
- Learning loops and conditions in JS
- Running your code through the terminal
- Creating and committing to a GitHub repository

Setting Up üë∑

- Install JavaScript
- Sign up for GitHub
- Commit a Readme.md (how to commit files on github)

Intro to Javascript üíª

- Learning loops, conditionals, and other fundamentals
- Creating a program to print items based on user input and mathematics

### **Week 2**

***

üìö **Summary**

This week, students will be working on a **Roman Calculator** that takes Roman numbers from the **user's input**, as well as **operands**, and prints the result of any math problem the user enters.  This will help the students master **parsing user input** and **develop a thorough understanding of mathematics and functions** in programming.

**Learning Objectives**

- Parsing user input and printing an output
- Effeciently translating variables (Roman numerals) to integers
- Performing mathematical operations in JS
- The benefits and importance of organizing code into functions
- Documenting your code using comments

### **Week 3**

***

:books: **Summary**

Students will learn the basics of **recursion** through this weeks assignment by creating a recursive function of their own.  To build off of this idea, we will show students how to **draw shapes** in JavaScript so that by the end of the week they can create recursive art by incorporating both ideas. 

**Learning Objectives**

- Gaining a general understanding of recursion and its role in mathematics and programming
- Creating a recursive function with real-life applications (ex: factorials)
- Drawing shapes using JS functions
- Making random shapes using JavaScript's `random` function
- Using these skills to create recursive art

### **Week 4**

***

:books: **Summary**

During the final week of the JavaScript BitCamp, students are to assemble their **final projects**.  Though students will have complete freedom with what they choose to do for this assignment, they must include the JavaScript skills that they learned from this course - **arrays, loops, conditionals, and recursion**, all while **utilizing the user's input to produce an output**.
