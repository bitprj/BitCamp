# Bitcamp JavaScript :rocket: 

JavaScript (JS) is an extremely useful tool for user interface (UI) design that allows the programmer to build interactive webpages. Some of the most essential items for a website's success are ease of navigation and an appealing design, thus making the mastery of JS a must for aspiring designers.

## The Goal 🥅

**Who?**  The material in this program is simplified so that those with minimal experience in computer science can try their hand at web design. This bootcamp was mainly designed for high school and college students, but aspiring coders of all ages are welcomed. Our instructors have an extensive background in coding, but are not experts with JS.

**What?** Concise and interactive Github Learning Lab that introduces and develops skills related to JS with [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest), a PC roleplaying game.

**How?** Students will gain experience with JS using TwilioQuest, learning the basics as well as some advanced topics, by creating an custom interactive interface with digital and analog clocks.

**When?** 

* *Week 1*: Set up environment, learn basic HTML and JS to print out current time.
* *Week 2*: Design webpage using HTML and CSS to create a custom stylized digital clock.
* *Week 3*: Construct an analog clock using knowledge gained from building a digital clock.
* *Week 4*: Integrate completed clocks into one interface and finish by adding advanced features.

**Where?** Tools used include GitHub, JS, Linux/OS Terminal, and TwilioQuest.

### Project Description

4-week course on using JS and TwilioQuest.

### ❗ Prerequisites for BitCamp JavaScript (Week 0)

The purpose of Week 0 is to **review or teach** skills required for success with the curriculum. Because this is an introductory course, we just ask that students familiarize themselves with the material by checking out the [JS website](https://www.javascript.com) and reading up on [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest).

### **Week 1**

**Learning Objectives**

- Creating a CSS file
- Defining classes for features in HTML
- Learning attributes and properties in HTML and CSS
- Stylizing digital clock and features in CSS

### **Week 3**

***

:books: **Summary**

Students will now **use the knowledge and experience they've gained** from building a digital clock to code a live **analog clock** that changes based on the user's selected time zone.

**Learning Objectives**

- Understanding basic syntax for HTML, CSS, and JS
- Creating an analog clock from the digital clock

### **Week 4** 

***

:books: **Summary**

For the final assignment, students will **integrate all previous assignments into a single interface** and add some bells and whistles.

**Learning Objectives**
