# Bitcamp JavaScript :rocket: 

JavaScript is an extremely useful tool for user interface (UI) design that allows the programmer to build interactive webpages.  Some of the most essential items for a website's success are ease of navigation and an appealing design, thus making mastery of JavaScript a must for aspiring designers.

## The Goal ü•Ö

**Who?**  The material in this program is simplified so that those with minimal experience in computer science can try their hand at web design. This bootcamp was mainly designed for high school and college students, but aspiring coders of all ages are welcomed. Our instructors have an extensive background in coding, but are not experts with JavaScript.

**What?** Concise and interactive Github Learning Lab that introduces and develops skills related to JavaScript with [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest).

**How?** Students will get experience with JavaScript, learning the basics as well as some advanced topics by completing assignments every week. In the end, students will use the knowledge theyve gained from TwilioQuest, a PC roleplaying game, to build a game of their choosing. 

**When?** 

* *Starting out:* Weeks 1 and 2 will help you produce simple JavaScript programs to help you get acclimated with all different aspects of the language.
* *The project:* In week 3, we will go over more advanced topics like recursion and making graphics in JS. In the fourth and final week, you will use all of your newly-acquired skills to build a game in TwilioQuest.

**Where?** Tools used include Github, JavaScript, Linux/OS Terminal, and TwilioQuest.

### Project Description

4-week course on using Javascript and TwilioQuest.

### ‚ùó Prerequisites for BitCamp JavaScript (Week 0)

The purpose of Week 0 is to **review or teach** skills required for success with the curriculum. Because this is an introductory course, we just ask that students familiarize themselves with the material by checking out the [JavaScript website](https://www.javascript.com) and reading up on [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest).

### **Week 1**

***

üìö **Summary**

Students will **learn about and set up tools** needed for the completion of the "FizzBuzz" project. This means going over creating a new JS file, using GitHub, and navigating/compiling your files using the Terminal.

**Learning Objectives**

- Creating a JS file
- Learning loops and conditions in JS
- Running your code through the terminal
- Creating and committing to a GitHub repository

Setting Up üë∑

- Install JavaScript
- Sign up for GitHub
- Commit a Readme.md (how to commit files on github)

Intro to Javascript üíª

- Learning loops, conditionals, and other fundamentals
- Creating a program to print items based on user input and mathematics

### **Week 2**

***

üìö **Summary**

This week, students will be working on a **Roman Calculator** that takes Roman numbers from the **user's input**, as well as **operands**, and prints the result of any math problem the user enters.  This will help the students master **parsing user input** and **develop a thorough understanding of mathematics and functions** in programming.

**Learning Objectives**

- Parsing user input and printing an output
- Effeciently translating variables (Roman numerals) to integers
- Performing mathematical operations in JS
- The benefits and importance of organizing code into functions
- Documenting your code using comments

### **Week 3**

***

:books: **Summary**

This week, we will introduce **HTML** and **CSS** to the students to give them a more in-depth and well-rounded idea of web design.  Lessons will focus on the fundamentals such as **HTML attributes** and **CSS properties** and how the two can be customized.  To make sure students have gained a basic understanding of the two languages, we will have them get started on a project where they will build a website using unique graphics they'll develop in HTML and CSS.

**Learning Objectives**

- Understanding basic syntax for HTML and CSS
- Learning attributes and properties in HTML and CSS
- Customizing HTML and CSS features
- Creating a unique site given these concepts

### **Week 4**

***

:books: **Summary**

Now that students have a general idea of how to use HTML and CSS, we will combine this knowledge with their experience with JavaScript to **create an interactive website**.  This week, students will add to the website they created last week to **incorportate JavaScript**.  They should also come up with and submit an idea for their final project, which will be some type of interactive site that utilizes all of the skills they've gained from this course. 

**Learning Objectives**

- Integrating JS with HTML and CSS
- Making a static site interactive with JS

### **Weeks 5 and 6**

***

:books: **Summary**

During the final weeks of the JavaScript BitCamp, students are to assemble their **final projects**.  Though students will have complete freedom with what they choose to do for this assignment, they must include the JavaScript skills that they learned from this course - **arrays, loops, conditionals, and design (HTML/CSS)**, all while **utilizing the user's input to produce an output**.
