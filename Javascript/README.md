# JavaScript :rocket: 

What is JavaScript? JavaScript (JS) is an extremely useful tool for user interface (UI) design that allows the programmer to build interactive webpages. Some of the most essential items for a website's success are ease of navigation and an appealing design, thus making the mastery of JS a must for aspiring designers.

Throughout the course, students will gain experience with JS using TwilioQuest, learning the basics as well as some advanced topics, by creating an custom interactive interface with digital and analog clocks.

**Prerequisites**

This introductory course is simplified so that those with minimal experience in computer science can try their hand at web design, so we just ask that students familiarize themselves with the material by checking out the [JS website](https://www.javascript.com) and reading up on [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest).

**Agenda**

* *Week 1*: Set up environment, learn basic HTML and JS to print out current time.
* *Week 2*: Design webpage using HTML and CSS to create a custom stylized digital clock.
* *Week 3*: Construct an analog clock using knowledge gained from building a digital clock.
* *Week 4*: Integrate completed clocks into one interface and finish by adding advanced features.

**Tools**

* VSCode
* Github 
* TwilioQuest
* Linux/OS Terminal
