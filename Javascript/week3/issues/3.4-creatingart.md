## Recursive Art

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

You've received some signals from aliens that decode to result in intricate graphics. These images have patterns that seem to repeat themselves and represent mathematical concepts which appear all around earth in nature. You have decided to recreate these messages in order to resume communication with the extraterrestrials.
### :airplane: Phase 4

Create a new file named artproject.js

**Creating your own Recursive Art**

It's finally time to send the aliens your own personalized art for them to decipher... We just have the 3 requirements in order to make communication go smoothly.

Here are some examples that you can take inspiration from, but try to keep yours original!

**Challenge**

Draw anything (with common sense) utilizing recursion. Meet these 3 requirements:
1) Have a base case (*This is the "endpoint" where the calculation terminates or stops*)
    * Remember: Recursion is **not** an infinite loop!
2) Have a rule that causes the calculation continue or go deeper and deeper (continues the recursion)
3) For fun: the artwork must be randomized, meaning that a characteristic (can be size, color, length, or shape) is changed everytime the code is run

### :red_car: Running your Code

*Since we are focusing on pure JavaScript and this task requires HTML to run, we are going to be borrowing Khan's website to display our artwork.*
1. Go to this [website](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs)
2. Write your code in the provided area
3. With randomization, a "restart" button will appear to run it multiple times

### :pencil2: Testing

Go ahead and press "restart" as many times as you wish to view your recursive art. Make sure it meets those 3 requirements!

### ✅ Submit

**Phase 2: Complete a program that creates a randomized piece of art with recursion!**

Commit a file called artproject.js
