# Introduction to Recursion

*This assignment will demonstrate the basics of recursion, and ask you to create a recursive function of your own. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

In English, the term "*recursive*" means something is "*characterized by recurrence or repetition*." Many natural processes in the world are recursive. As an example, start with an equilateral triangle, and replace the middle 1/3rd of each side by another equilateral triangle. Continue this process over and over until you begin to see something like a snowflake. This is called a [Koch snowflake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake).

**Recursion** is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. A function is said to be **recursive** if it calls itself. Let's look at an example.

```javascript
function HelloWorld(count) {
   if (count < 1) return
   print("Hello World!")
   HelloWorld(count - 1)
}
```

Let's trace through an example of calling this function. We'll call `HelloWorld(5)`. 

```javascript
HelloWorld(5)
// count of 5 is not less than 1. Print Hello World. Call HelloWorld(4).
// count of 4 is not less than 1. Print Hello World. Call HelloWorld(3).
// count of 3 is not less than 1. Print Hello World. Call HelloWorld(2).
// count of 2 is not less than 1. Print Hello World. Call HelloWorld(1).
// count of 1 is not less than 1. Print Hello World. Call HelloWorld(0).
// count of 0 IS less than 1. Return.
```

Notice how the command `print("Hello World!")` is run 5 times in total throughout this recursive call. Thus, our output should look something like this:

```bash
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
```

You may wonder why we don't simply use a `for` loop, in which case your argument would be completely valid! However, in this case, we used a relatively simple function in order to demonstrate how recursion works. Where recursion truly shines is in the more complex problems.

Let's take a look at the Fibonacci numbers. In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers** form a sequence called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. What's cool is that the Fibonacci sequence uses zero-based indexing, which lends itself very well to most programming languages. Here is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence:

![fibonacci sequence](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0,%201,%201,%202,%203,%205,%208,%2013,%2021,%2034,%2055,%2089,%2014,...)

How can we use code to find the *n*th Fibonacci number? For example, we would input the number 3 and the program should output 2, the 3rd Fibonacci number (remember that the Fibonacci sequence uses zero-based indexing!). It turns out that recursion lends itself very well to this particular problem.

```javascript
function findFibonacci(n) {
    if (n < 2) return n
    return findFibonacci(n-1) + findFibonacci(n-2)
}
```

 Let's trace through the code using an example of ``findFibonacci(3)``.

```javascript
findFibonacci(3)
// n of 3 is not less than 2. return findFibonacci(2) + findFibonacci(1)
  // findFibonacci(2): n of 2 is not less than 2. return findFibonacci(1) + findFibonacci(0)
    // findFibonacci(1): n of 1 IS less than 2. return n (which is 1)
    // findFibonacci(0): n of 0 IS less than 2. return n (which is 0)
    // Thus, findFibonacci(1) + findFibonacci(0) = 1 + 0 = 1 
  // findFibonacci(1): n of 1 IS less than 2. return n (which is 1)
  // Thus, findFibonacci(2) + findFibonacci(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
Output: 2
```

Take some time to run through the process above and make sure it makes sense. There is something we should take care to note: notice how we run the function `findFibonacci(1)` twice! This actually becomes *incredibly* burdensome once we use larger numbers, and we can end up running the same functions hundreds, even thousands of times - and there is most definitely a faster way to compute the Fibonacci numbers. However, this is beyond the scope of the course, and we utilized this function just to show an example of what recursion can look like. 

Pay attention to how our recursive functions have been structured so far. We first always identify **a base case** such that our recursive calls will always be stopped at some point. In `findFibonacci(n)`, our base case was any *n* less than 2, to mark the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1. In `Hello World`, our base case was `count < 1` i.e. whenever our count got down to 0. This makes sense because once our count comes down to zero, we don't want to print any more `Hello World!`s. Thus, our first recommendation for writing recursive functions is to **always identify the base case first!**

Your next step should then to make the recursive calls. This skill can only be polished with more practice, so don't worry if you don't get it the first time. Our best advice here is to **trust that your code works**.

Hopefully you now have a sense of what recursion is, and a vague idea of how to construct a recursive function. Don't worry if you're struggling a little bit with thinking recursively - it will start coming naturally with more and more practice. If you're looking to try out a few more problems by yourself, [this](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1) is a great website with a list of incrementally harder recursion problems to solve! Although it only compiles Java (not JavaScript), you can use Node to run your code locally on your machine instead. Moreover, in the website, you can type a return statement in the given code box and click the `Go`  button to find many more test cases to ensure your program runs correctly.

**🚗 Challenge**

To complete this assignment, create a recursive function that returns the factorial of an integer *n* (without using a for loop!). Recall that the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20factorial%20of,convention%20for%20an%20empty%20product.) of a number n is denoted by *n!*, where:

![factorial definition](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n!=n%20\cdot%20(n-1)\cdot%20(n-2)\cdot%20(n-3)\cdot...\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1)

For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

Hint: Identify a base case first! Then move onto the recursive call. Please contact your TA if you need any help at all!

### ✏️ Testing

Once you have your function set up, it's time to test it out! Here are a few test cases:

| Function Call | Output    |
| ------------- | --------- |
| factorial(1)  | 1         |
| factorial(2)  | 2         |
| factorial(3)  | 6         |
| factorial(4)  | 24        |
| factorial(5)  | 120       |
| factorial(6)  | 720       |
| factorial(7)  | 5040      |
| factorial(8)  | 40320     |
| factorial(12) | 479001600 |
