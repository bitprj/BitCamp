### :question: How will this help students?

This livestream shows how to connect frontend (the basic HTML/CSS website students create) to the backend, their HTTP trigger Azure Function. The students can then apply this to their own Emotion Reader project by creating a static website, using it to call their Azure Function, and finally displaying the received data on the webpage.
