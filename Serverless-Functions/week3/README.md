# Week 3: HTML, CSS, and Post Request

Last week, you should've learned the basics of how to create an Azure Function, along with the basics of triggers and bindings.

### :books: Summary
During Week 3, students are finishing up their "Emotion Reader" project by coding the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JS. They will code and style the page; integrate JS that makes a POST request to the HTTP Trigger they created in Week 2 and displays emotion data. By the time their project is finished, students will have experience working with APIs, Azure Functions, and connecting frontend to backend.<br />

<br />*Students will have a working web app that takes a face image as an input, makes a request to the HTTP Trigger, and displays emotion data.*

### Learning Objectives
- Creating an HTML webpage with CSS
- Upload an image with a form
- Making a HTTP POST request to an Azure Function
- Parsing and displaying data retrieved from call


### Livestream
In the livestream, we're going to be going over how to create a basic HTML and CSS website that takes an image in as an input. As well, you will be learning how to use jQuery to send an image through a POST request to your Azure Function.

- For the full code, look in the [code folder](https://github.com/bitprj/Bitcamp-Serverless/blob/master/week3/livestream/loom.md).

We'll be going over how to:
1. Code a page in HTML
2. Stylize it in CSS
3. Send an image through a POST request
4. Call your Azure Function


### Homework
Create an HTML webpage that allows the user to submit an image and submit by pressing a button.
- The step by step runthrough is located in the [issues folder](https://github.com/bitprj/Bitcamp-Serverless/blob/master/week3/homework/issues). Follow the issues numerically to complete the project. 
- Any starter and solution code is in the [code folder](https://github.com/bitprj/Bitcamp-Serverless/tree/master/week3/homework/code/solution) in homework.

### :question: How will this help students?

This livestream shows how to connect frontend (the basic HTML/CSS website students create) to the backend, their HTTP trigger Azure Function. The students can then apply this to their own Emotion Reader project by creating a static website, using it to call their Azure Function, and finally displaying the received data on the webpage.
