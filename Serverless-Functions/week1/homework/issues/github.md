### GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based repository hosting service that is widely used in the tech industry. It allows teams to use Git for version control, collaboration, and file management. If you don't know what Git is, it's a version-control system for tracking changes, managing state, and concurrently developing on the same files or directories. Git and Github's tools are specifically designed to make coordinating work easier, and they are one of the most pervasive shared tools among students and the industry.
