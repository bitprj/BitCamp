# Building your own Serverless Project :zap:

### :brain: Brainstorming
After students complete Weeks 0 to 3, they have the skills needed to take on their own Azure Functions final project. This has essentially no bounds--except for the fact that it has to use Azure Functions!

**Here are some projects from our BitCampers to get you started:**
* IOT Heart Rate monitor
* Spotify Song Recommendation Engine
* File-sharing and conversion Web App
* Power-grid Usage Alerter
* Amazon Product Recommendation Engine
* And... many more! Check out the descriptions [here](https://www.notion.so/Building-Cool-Projects-with-Serverless-Functions-7c8e31c3d33044e7af5f95942ebac20d) and [here](https://dev.to/azure/get-inspired-by-these-bitcamp-final-projects-by-high-school-students-5c30)

### üìùMapping it out
To get started with building, students will first need to create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components they will include to make there project work. Nothing has to be finalized, but planning it out allows students to organize their ideas and thought processes.<br />

### üíªStarting the project
It's time to start the *real* part: coding. The best approach recommended by our BitCamp mentors is to "start small then build big."
* Begin by just having one working component of the project. Ex: 
  * Press a button on your webpage and receive information
  * Create a working Azure Function that can return information
* After that's complete, begin **building onto that** with more and more features!

### ‚úÖ Done?
Our campers always write a blog about their project to share with others. This includes what inspired their idea, how to replicate their cool Azure Function project, and any other information someone would need. Refer to the blogs [here](https://dev.to/azure/get-inspired-by-these-bitcamp-final-projects-by-high-school-students-5c30) to see some examples.
