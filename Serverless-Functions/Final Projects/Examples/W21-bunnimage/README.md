# bunnimage

Week 4 - Week 8 **BitCamp** project that utilizes **Microsoft Azure Functions** (HTML trigger, Blob Storage, Event Grid Triggers) to allow users to upload an image from a sending device and receive it in PDF form on a receiving device. (ie. Take a picture on your phone, upload it, and download from laptop)

Note: Currently the Functions are disabled and therefore the project is not currently up and running.
