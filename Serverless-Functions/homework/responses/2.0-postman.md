## Postman, APIs, and requests

Later, when we begin to code our Azure Function, we are going to need to test it. How? Just like our final web app, we'll be sending requests to the Function's endpoint.

**Since our Azure Function will be taking a picture in the request, we are going to be using *Postman* to test it.**

You can install Postman from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) as a Chrome extension.

### What will Postman do?

We are going to use Postman to send a POST request to our Azure Function to test if it works, mimicking what our static website will do.

Our HTTP trigger Azure Function will be an [API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) that receives requests and sends back information.

To introduce you to sending requests to an API and how Postman works, we'll be sending a GET request to an API.

1. You can choose to sign up or skip and go directly to the app.

2. Close out all the tabs that pop up until you reach **this screen**

Now it is time to send a GET request to a Cat Picture API.
The goal? Receive a cat picture with "Bitcamp" written on it in a specified color and text size.

Try it out yourself:
* API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
* Parameters: `color` (color of the text) and `text` (font size)

2. **Setting Parameters:** Click on "Params" and enter `color` into Key and the color you want (eg. blue) into Value. Enter `text` into the next Key row and a number (eg. 50) into Value.

3. **Click `Send` to get your cat picture**
