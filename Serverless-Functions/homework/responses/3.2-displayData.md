## Displaying Emotion Data

**Javascript:** In order to send and receive a request to the Azure Function, we must have Javascript to take these tasks.

### Concepts to know:
* Javascript Events
* JSON format
* jQuery

Now that our image has been analyzed by the Face API, we have received emotion data in JSON format. Our task is to read the JSON file and output the emotions in the image (ie. anger, contempt, disgust, etc).

The first thing we need to do is create a function called `loadFile(event) {}` which creates a variable called `image` that gets the ID `"output"` and displays the image the user uploaded. To do this, we need to get the element ID by using `document.getElementByID(id)`:

```javascript
var image = //Call for element ID here
```

We also need to call for the image source using `.createObjectURL(event.target.files[0])`. Use `.src` on the image variable and call for the first file uploaded using the code above. When it's all put together, it should look something like this:

```javascript
function loadFile(event) {
    var image = //set div for image output
    image.src = //Load inputted image
};
```

### Checkpoint #4

Quick intermission: 
1. Navigate to the HTML page we created
2. Attempt to upload an image
3. Does it display as a thumbnail?

Now we need to create our main function called `handle(event) {}`. This will take in the response; then, using the data from the Face API, it will create a new form that includes the amount of different emotions. As well, using the data from the Face API, it will display numerical values of emotion.

1. Using [jQuery](http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics), target the output element ID and change the content to equal "Loading". Then add the line, `event.preventDefault();` to disable the ability to reload the page. To event target with jQuery, use this sample:

   ```javascript
   console.log ("submitting form...");
   $(/*Add ID here*/).html(/*Add content here*/)
   //make sure to disable reload here...
   ```

2. After telling our HTML to show the content "Loading", we need to set a few variables to create a new form with our emotion data. We can do this by adding a variable set to an element ID and creating a new `FormData` object based on the received information:

   ```javascript
   var myform = document.getElementById('myform');
       var payload = new FormData(myform);
   
       const resp = await fetch(/*Add Function URL */, {
           method: 'POST',
           body: payload
   });
   ```

3. Next, we have to add a variable for the JSON data. Make a new variable called `data` and set it to the response JSON like we did earlier. If you need a hint, use the `.json()` function. We also need another variable, `emotion`, which will be set to `data.result[0].faceAttributes.emotion;`. This sets `emotion` to the first result in our JSON data, and pulls the information out into a value. 

### Checkpoint #5
Just like we tested the Azure Function earlier by printing out something into our log, we will do the same with our JavaScript. 

**Objective**: Check if the code successfully makes a request to the Azure Function and receives emotion data by logging the value in the variable `emotion`.
> Tip: Check the log using "Inspect element" or F12 and clicking on Console:

`console.log(emotion)`

</details>

Lastly, we have to create the HTML that will actually be displayed:

   ​	i. First, create an `<h3>` tag for the title labelled `emotions in this image:` (make sure to add `<br />` at the end to skip a line)

   ​	ii. Now create 8 `<p>` tags that each show data for a different emotion. The list of emotions are anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. 

   ​	iii. To get the data, remember we set `var emotion` to pull the first value. All we have to do is use jQuery and use this formatting. I've done the first one for you:

   ```javascript
   var resultString = `
   <h3> Emotions in the image: </h3><br />
   <p> anger: ${emotion.anger}</p>

   `;
   // Finish for other data types using the same format (i.e. ${emotion.contempt}, and etc)
   ```
The last thing we need to do is to use jQuery to change the emotion div, `emotion`. 

   ```javascript
   $('#emotion').html(/* Emotion Data should go here */);
   ```
<br />
