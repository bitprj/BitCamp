## Submitting Final Project Proposals

Congratulations! You're on the final stretch, and we'll now begin working on our final projects!

Here are the proposal instructions.

**Flowchart:**  Create a flowchart on [draw.io](draw.io) that demonstrates how you will implement your solution. Your flowchart should show all APIs (including your Azure Function) that you will be using, and what data is being passed between each step.

For example: ![](https://github.com/thearchitectsnotebook/azure-functions-course/blob/master/images/proposal-flow-chart.PNG?raw=true)

**Project Proposal:** Create a pdf of your flowchart and a description of your project. Include the problem that you aim to solve and describe how your project provides a viable solution. Please include any questions that you currently have or anticipate to have about your project’s implementation.

**To move on, commit the PDF of your project proposal to the repo, and comment a one sentence summary of what your project is about!**
