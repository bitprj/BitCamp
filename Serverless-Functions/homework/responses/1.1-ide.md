## Downloading an IDE

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### Visual Studio Code

Before we start coding, we need to install an IDE. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Although there are hundreds of IDEs to choose from, we are going to use Visual Studio Code due to its popularity and integration with Azure (via extensions and libraries).

To install VSC, go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and choose your operating system (ie. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Then click **Download** and run the installer (usually a `.exe` or `.zip` file). After it's installed, open it up and try it out. If you need some help navigating VSC, check out this super helpful [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ) video.

5. If you have node installed on your computer, open terminal on VS Code and type 'node hello.js'
