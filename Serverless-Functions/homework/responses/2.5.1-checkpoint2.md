## Checkpoint 2

Time to test our completed Azure Function! It should now successfully do these tasks:

* Parse the image
* Send image to Face API and return Face data

This time, we won't need to add any additional code, as the completed function should return the emotion data on its own.

* Navigate back to the Postman Chrome extension app and change GET to POST

* Copy your function's url from the Azure Function App portal like this:

![httptrigger - Microsoft Azure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/98876502-6f65f780-244c-11eb-832b-a25888b980da.gif)

* Use the function url and any image you want to send the POST request. Remember to attach the file in Body!

Only difference is that we should **receive an output in Postman instead:**

Make sure you're using an image with a *real face* on it or else it won't work. Here's an example of an output I get with this image:
