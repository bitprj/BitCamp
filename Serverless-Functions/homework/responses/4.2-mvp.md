## Submitting an MVP

A [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable. Releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work.

Submit a working (loose definition) version of your MVP. Your project does not have to work smoothly or look presentable; it just needs to have a few main components (Azure Function included) that are interacting with each other.

**To move on, commit your MVP to this repo, and comment a brief summary of the problems you ran into while building it!**
