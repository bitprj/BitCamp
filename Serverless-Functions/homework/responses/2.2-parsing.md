In your Azure Portal, go into your HTTP function and into the index.js file. You should see starter code there that has something like `module.exports...`.
This is the file that we will be editing.

**The Azure Function needs to:**

1. Receive and parse an image from a webpage
2. Call the Face API and analyze the image

*What is happening in this flowchart?*

**HTML Page:** Where the user will submit an image; this page will also make a request with the image to the Azure Function.

**Azure Function:** Receives the request from HTML Page with the image. In order to receive it, **we must parse the image...**

### Concepts to know:
* Parsing data
* Node dependency packages
* Body and Headers of a request

*We're going to be focusing on Part 1, which involves parsing [multipart form data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526273/what-does-enctype-multipart-form-data-mean).* 

In any HTML `<form>` element that receives involves a file upload (which ours does), the data is encoded in the `multipart/form-data` method. 

The default http encoding method is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which encodes text into name/value pairs and works for text inputs, but it is inefficient for files or binary inputs. 

`multipart/form-data` indicates that one or more files are being inputted. Parsing this type of data is a little more complicated than usual. To simplify the process, we're going to use an npm library called `parse-multipart`.  

To import Node packages, we use the `require`  function:

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart");
```

This imports the `parse-multipart`  package into our code, and we can now call any function in the package using `multipart.Function()`. 

Your function should look like this:

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart");

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.'); 
};
 
```

Before we start parsing, go to the [parse-multipart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-multipart) documentation for some context on what the package does.  Look specifically at the example in the **Usage** section and what they are doing, as we're going to do something similar.

Notice that `multipart.Parse(body, boundary)`  requires two parameters.  I've already gotten the boundary for you â€“ just like the documentation example, our boundary is a string in the format `"----WebKitFormBoundary(random characters here)"`. 

In the `multipart.Parse()` call, you need to figure out what the body parameter should be.

Hint: It should be the request body. Think about the example Azure function. How did we access that?

```js

//here's your boundary:
var boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
  
// TODO: assign the body variable the correct value
var body = '<WHAT GOES HERE?>'

// parse the body
var parts = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);
```
