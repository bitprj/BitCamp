## Checkpoint #1

> Congrats! You've made it to the first checkpoint. We're going to make sure your Azure Function can complete its first task: **parsing the image.**

1. In order to make sure your function is correctly receiving and parsing the image, we are going to be adding a line of code in the module.exports function to **print out the image data in our Azure console.**

*Hint: take a look at the ```var parts...``` line*

<details>
<summary>Need an explanation?</summary>
<br>

* Use context.log() to print to console
* Our last line of code, `var parts = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);`, stored our parsed image...
* We only have one image, so let's access it in the array with the index of 0: `parts[0]`

Final line of code: `context.log(parts[0]);`

</details>

2. Let's use our **Postman** skills to make a **POST request to the Azure Function.**

* Navigate back to the Postman Chrome extension app and change GET to POST

* Copy your function's url from the Azure Function App portal like this:

* Use the function url and any image you want to send the POST request. By default, the request is going to be in the form of a "Param" and you want to change this to "Body" > "form-data". Remember to attach the file in Body! You will need to add the name of the file (e.g. "image") in Key and upload the image in "Value". You can add a description if you'd like but this is not entirely necessary.

* When you hit send to send the request, make sure to have your Function open in another tab to observe what happens. You should get something like this:

Remember, we are using Postman to test the request before we go ahead and create the website that will allow us to upload an image and make the request. If you come across any errors here, make sure to debug them (Google is a great resource) before moving forwards.
