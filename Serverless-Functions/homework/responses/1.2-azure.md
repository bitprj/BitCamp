### Azure

So what is "Azure"? According to Microsoft:

> Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. Itâ€™s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

If you want to learn more about Azure and all its cloud applications, feel free to check out this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/), an overview of its capabilities.

To create an Azure account, go to: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ and press **Start free** to be relocated to a signup page. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card. Rest assured, this is only for security purposes (preventing multiple free accounts per person), and **you won't be charged** unless you choose to buy a premium account, which we do not need for this course. 

If you need some help navigating Azure, check out this super helpful [resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/) provided by Microsoft.

**Task 2: create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs the current time and date.**

This time we'll try developing locally. Follow the directions in this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local) to set up and deploy your first Azure Function right in your local machine. Then to move on, commit your code to the learning lab repository and post a comment below describing what you completed.
