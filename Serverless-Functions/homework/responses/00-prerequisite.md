## Prerequisite: Fundamentals of JavaScript

Note: Most of these items should be done already! Read the bottom of the doc to continue :smile:

Welcome to **Bit Camp**, where students get hands-on experience with software engineering. Before the program starts, please find some time to complete the following assignment: learn/review JavaScript fundamentals that will later be used in the program. To complete this assignment, you will be creating a digital clock using JavaScript to demonstrate your skills! If you need any help, refer to these resources:

- W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
- Tutorialspoint: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_overview.htm
- Modern JS: https://javascript.info/

If you have specific questions, try out Stack Overflow (it is super duper helpful):

After you have learned/refreshed your knowledge of JavaScript, let's get started on making that clock. Here is the list of the requirements and some extensions you can complete if you have extra time!

**Requirements:**

- Display 12/24 HR time with hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Must be created using JavaScript (plus appropriate HTML and CSS for formatting and styling)

**Extensions:**

- Turn your clock from digital to analog mode (hint: you're gonna need a lot of CSS for this...)
- Use CSS to style your clock (i.e. make it blue, green, yellow, etc)
- Create animations for your clock (ie. when the minute hand changes, it rotates/spins)

*Don't know where to get started?* Start off by creating a new function that starts your clock:

```js
function startTime() {}
```

After this, you will need to create three variables:

```javascript
var hr = " ";
var min = " ";
var sec = " ";
```

Also, make sure to reference the HTML you created the "clock" id in:

```javascript
document.getElementById("clock").innerHTML = " ";
```

Good job, hopefully your digital clock is fully working and your jQuery is linked to our HTML and CSS files. Your next task is a bit more tricky... you're making another clock but this time... in analog mode!

### Don't know where to put your code? Try using this online interpreter: [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/html)!

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to your TAs! Your last step is to create a Github account if you don't have one yet, create a repository to store your project, and upload your files. *We will cover Github in this course, so if you don't know how to use it, no worries! Give it your best try for now.*
