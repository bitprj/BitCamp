## Before the Function can be used:

Before the Azure Function can run, we have to install all the necessary package dependencies. We will be using the `parse-multipart`  and `node-fetch` packages (more details on that later). These packages must be manually installed in the console using npm install.

At this point, you should have created a new HTTP trigger function in your Azure portal along with the Function App. If you have not done this, please do it now. Navigate to your Function App. **This is not the function code, but the actual app service resource**.

In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install parse-multipart

npm install node-fetch
```

The first creates a **package.json** file to store your dependencies. The next two actually install the necessary packages.

*Note: If you get red text like `WARN`, that is expected and normal*

You should be good to go! Reach out to your TA's if there are any issues!

**Once you are done, write a comment describing what you completed.**
