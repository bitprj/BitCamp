## Prerequisite: Fundamentals of JavaScript

Welcome to **Bit Camp**, where students get hands-on experience with software engineering. Before the program starts, please find some time to complete the following assignment: learn/review JavaScript fundamentals that will later be used in the program. To complete this assignment, you will be creating a digital clock using JavaScript to demonstrate your skills! If you need any help, refer to these resources:

After you have learned/refreshed your knowledge of JavaScript, let's get started on making that clock. Here is the list of the requirements and some extensions you can complete if you have extra time!

**Requirements:**

- Display 12/24 HR time with hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Must be created using JavaScript (plus appropriate HTML and CSS for formatting and styling)

**Extensions:**

- Turn your clock from digital to analog mode (hint: you're gonna need a lot of CSS for this...)
- Use CSS to style your clock (ie: make it blue, green, yellow, etc)
- Create animations for your clock (ie. when the minute hand changes, it rotates/spins)

*Don't know where to get started?* Start off by creating a new function that starts your clock:

```js
function startTime() {}
```

After this, you will need to create three variables:

```javascript
var hr = " ";
var min = " ";
var sec = " ";
```

Also, make sure to reference the HTML you created the "clock" id in:

```javascript
document.getElementById("clock").innerHTML = " ";
```

Good job, hopefully your digital clock is fully working and your jQuery is linked to our HTML and CSS files. Your next task is a bit more tricky... you're making another clock but this time... in analog mode!
