# Week 0: Fundamentals of JavaScript

This week (prerequisite) will focus on teaching/revisiting key JavaScript skills to complete the 4 week learning lab where you will create a Emotion Reader Engine with Azure Functions and a Face API. Students complete this project as a prerequisite *prior* to the start of camp as a review resource.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Reviewing basics of JavaScript
- Templating in JavaScript
- Integrating files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Learning needed coding prerequisites 

**Homework:**

Your task is to learn/relearn the fundamentals of JavaScript through simple activities and a final project... making a digital clock in JavaScript. To complete this project, you will be using key JavaScript skills like jQuery, templating, and basics (variables, functions, syntax, etc).

**Example:**

This project required knowledge of CSS, HTML, JS, and jQuery.

### ❗ Prerequisites for BitCamp Serverless:

The purpose of Week 0 is to **review or teach** skills required for success with the curriculum. Building a JS Clock requires students to understand the basics of JS, templating in JS, and integrating HTML, CSS, and JS. Week 1 will help students set up tools needed to build the project!
> Note that these are skills needed mainly for developing a frontend. Students will be introduced to APIs, Functions, and making requests later in the course during Week 2 and 3.
