# Documentation for Bit Camp Mentorship

### What is Bit Camp?

A Bit Camp is Bit Project's version of a software bootcamp. Our Bit Camps are all free and open source, intended to make tech education more accessible for students around the world. The curriculum, livestream videos, and homeworks are available on our GitHub repos, Twitch channel, and YouTube channel. Although open to everyone, our Bit Camps also have an application for students to be more involved in the live program. Students who get in will have access to mentorship, office hours from our student mentors, and feedback on their homework and final project. Mentors will only be assigned to these students.

### Bit Camp Components

- Weekly livestreams

    Throughout the program, a Bit Project student mentor will host livestreams that serve as lectures for the bootcamp. They will be held at the same day and time every week. Student mentors will often code live during the stream to teach various topics, and students can follow along as they watch. The syllabus for each week can be found in the GitHub repo for the Bit Camp. After each livestream, the recorded video will be posted to the repo as well. Mentors are not required to attend these livestreams, but are encouraged to look at the syllabus for each week to keep up to date on the topics and concepts students are learning.  

- Homework

    Students will be assigned weekly homework to complete outside of the livestream. These homework will be a continuation of the topics and concepts taught in that week's livestream. Students may reach out for help with homework in our communication channels. Although mentors are more than welcome to help, Bit Project's own student mentors will be the main ones responsible for helping students with homework.

- Final project

    One or more weeks before the end of the program (depending on the Bit Camp), livestreams and homework will end and students will begin work on their final projects. Students are expected to discuss their final project ideas with their mentors in advance, and keep their mentors updated during their weekly session on their progress. They are also encouraged to get advice and help from their mentors for these projects. We will provide example projects either from past iterations of the Bit Camp or our own if it is the first iteration. These projects will be a good representation of the level of complexity we expect students' projects to be. We will have these ready before the Bit Camp starts so mentors have a chance to familiarize themselves with what to expect.

- Weekly mentoring sessions

    Our weekly mentoring sessions are the main component that mentors are responsible for. Every week, mentors will set up either 1-1 or group sessions with their mentees. Mentors and students can collaborate to choose which format (1-1 or group) they prefer as well as the days and times of each session. We only ask that mentors make sure all students get a chance to speak if a group session is chosen. The purpose of these sessions is for students to be able to develop meaningful relationships with developers in the industry, ask questions about the concepts and topics they are learning, and get advice and help on their final projects. Mentors can expect to have 2-3 mentees and spend around 2-3 hours per week on these sessions.

- Channel for communication (discord or slack)

    There will be an open channel of communication for students, mentors, and the Bit Project team. The medium will be either Discord or Slack and everyone will get invites the week before the program starts. This channel will be used for all communication related to the Bit Camp.

- Final project presentation webinar

    At the end of the program, we will hold a final project presentation webinar. Mentors are highly encouraged to attend to support their students and see the culmination of the their work.

### Mentor Expectations and Responsibilities

- Knowledge of Bit Camp topics/concepts
    - Our GitHub repos contain all of the Bit Camp curriculum and will be finalized in advance of the program start so mentors have a chance to look through it and brush up on any skills required. These bootcamps are intended for beginners and topics will not be overly complex or difficult

- Setting up weekly mentoring sessions with assigned students (2-3 hours/week)
    - Developing relationships with your mentees by discussing interests, goals, technology
    - Assist students with understanding Bit Camp topics and concepts
    - Give guidance and help on students' final projects

- Checking communication channel daily to ensure you don't miss important messages from the Bit Project team or your students

- Reviewing weekly livestream syllabus to stay up to date on what students are learning (~10-15 min/week)

- Informing the Bit Project team of any problems that arise either with the students or yourself so we can deal with them in a timely manner

- Providing us with feedback on your mentorship experience and any other part of the Bit Camp at the end of the program. We will reach out to set up a meeting for this

### Students

- Level of experience

    Our Bit Camps are intended for beginners. Students may be completely new to programming or they may have experience in programming, but not in the specific topic of the Bit Camp. Mentors can expect beginner to intermediate high school and college students.   

- Weekly interactions with students

    Students may not always come with questions ready for mentoring sessions. Mentoring sessions are not just for homework and final project help, but also to develop meaningful relationships between mentors and students. Mentors are encouraged to ask students about their interests, education, goals, as well as share their own stories about their journey into technology.

- Communication Channel

    Mentors and students are expected to keep an open line of communication in the provided channels. If any students are not responding to messages, missing weekly mentoring sessions, or displaying any other problems, please let the Bit Project team know and we will take care of it.

### Final Words

Aside from this document, the Bit Project team will set up a live info session for mentors the week before each Bit Camp. At this session or any time leading up to it, feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns about mentoring.

We really appreciate everyone who volunteers to mentor our students and dedicate their time and effort to this cause. Thank you!
