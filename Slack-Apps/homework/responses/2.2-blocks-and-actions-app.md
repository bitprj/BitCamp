## Building an App with Block Kits and Actions 

#### Use BlockKits and Actions to make a Slack App.

Now it's time to make a block kit yourself! Your goal will be to write an app that will listen for the word 'hello' in a workspace's channels, then respond in the same channel announcing that who person said hello. The message should include a block kit with a button saying 'click me'. If someone clicks the button, then the app announces that a person clicked the button in a regular message.

> **Note**: Before you start, make sure to create your app with the scopes and events  for messaging in a channel.



## Creating a Message

The first method you will need to use is ```.message()```.  This method will help you listen for an incoming message of your choice. Below is the method signature for ```.message()```:

```javascript
app.message('<incoming_message>', async ({ message, say }) => {
});
```

Copy and paste this code with the right incoming message parameter.  Within the function, you will write the actual message using ```say()``` to the channel where the event was triggered. Precede this function call with ```await```, which is an expression in Javascript that forces the function to wait until a promise is settled. In this case, the promise is that the event occurs. Your code should look like this:

```javascript
app.message('<incoming_message>', async ({ message, say }) => {
	await say({
	});
});
```



## Creating a Block Kit

Within the ```say()``` function call, you will create a block to present the message and block nicely. The first block will be a text section, something like 'hello'. The second will be the button. Since the text will be the main section of the block kit, the button will be considered an accessory, which needs to be specified in the block.

```json
blocks: [
      {
        "type": "section",
        "text": {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": `Hey there <@${message.user}>!`
        },
        "accessory": {
          "type": "button",
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Click Me"
          },
          "action_id": "button_click"
        }
      }
    ]
```

Besides that distinction, the creation of both a button and a section are almost the same. However, the button can also have an ```action``` property, which means that when the user interacts with it, you are able to access a payload with the information for the event. In this case, the the app used an action called "button_click". This name is completely arbitrary, but is clear on the type of event that occurred.

The last parameter for the ```say()``` function is a text in case the block does not work. 



## Creating an Action

Since the button in your message has an action, you will need to acknowledge the event. This will require another function, ```.action()```. 

```javascript
app.action('button_click', async ({ body, ack, say }) => {
});
```

The function signature includes the action id that you created for the button block. All that is left in this function is to aknowlege the action and then send a message:

```javascript
await ack();
await say(`<@${body.user.id}> clicked the button`);
```



Test your app and make sure everything works. If you need any help, you can ask either of your mentors.

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
