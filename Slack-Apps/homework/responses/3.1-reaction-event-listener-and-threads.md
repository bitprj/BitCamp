## Google Translate API: Event Listener & Threads

#### Introduction to a new event listener and responding in threads.

**If you missed the livestream or are unable to view the recording, here is a link to a written copy: https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/blob/master/Slack-Apps/week3/blog.md**

During the livestream, you were introduced to two new concepts: a new event listener to emoji reactions and a new way of having your Slack App respond to a thread. In this issue, you will be incorportating these concepts as you integrate your Slack App with your first third party API, Google Translate!

## Event Listeners

Before we introduce the Google Translate API, make sure you understand how the new event listener works as well as how to make your Slack App respond to a thread:

Emoji Reactions: https://api.slack.com/events/reaction_added
 ```javascript 
 app.event('reaction_added', async ({ event, client }) => {
 /* Listening for Reaction Emojis */
 });

```
Using ```app.event('reaction_added')```acts as an event listener whenever a user responds to a message with a reaction (this can be any emoji ex: smile, heart, or even a flag!). We will be using the reaction_added event listener for our Slack App that translates a user's message to a language based on the nationality of the flag the user reacts to the message with.

```javascript
const { reaction, user, item: { channel, ts } } = event;
```

Here, we are setting the reaction value to a constant in order to compare it to a list of languages. However, the names of some emojis don't exactly represent the language we need to translate to which is why we have to create a map of country codes corresponding with the APIs values. An example of this:
```javascript
const langMap = {
      mx: ['es', 'Spanish'],
      es: ['es', 'Spanish'],
      ru: ['ru', 'Russian'],
      jp: ['ja', 'Japanese'],
    }
```
Using these two concepts, we need to create a segment of code that compares the name value of the flag to see whether the Google Translate API incorporates its value and if not, uses are map of country codes.

To do this, we will need to create a new constant called ```validFlag``` and compare it with our constant called reaction (which we set already) and test if ```reaction.includes ('flag-')```. If it doesn't, we compare it to our language Map (```const langMap```). After, if ```reaction.includes ('flag-')``` we need to split the string into two parts by using ```reaction.split(-)```.

Now we would incorporate the Google Translate API but first we are going to write the code to send our translated text in a thread. To do so, we need to create a ```await client.chat.postMessage({ Edit Here });```

Inside here, we are passing through a few things: channel, thread_ts, and text. In our ```const reaction``` we recorded the channel, and ts which we can pass through for the first and second argument. For our text argument, we need to pass through the translated message. We will finish this argument when we incorporate the Google Translate API!

If you have any further questions, please reach out to your mentors!

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
