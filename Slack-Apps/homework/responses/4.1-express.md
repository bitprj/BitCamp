#### Learn about ExpressJS and what it can do.

This week will involve using a popular JavaScript framework called Express. Frameworks give you a fundamental structure that you can build on without starting completely from scratch. For example, Bolt is also a framework. 



## ðŸ“šReading Up

Express is a pretty large framework, so you will need to do a little reading to understand its basic functions. Look at the Express-related sections in [this article](https://codeforgeek.com/express-nodejs-tutorial/) for some general information.

After you are done, read [this article](https://codeforgeek.com/handle-get-post-request-express-4/) on POST and GET requests. Comment one idea for a Slack app using Express and a couple of things that stood out to you or you had questions on while researching the framework. 



## ðŸ”¨Challenge

Create a post request that prints a hello message to your local host server. Create another post request that takes parameters for a book and author, then prints out a sentence using the information.

Refer to the articles above and feel free to reach out to your mentors with any questions!

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
