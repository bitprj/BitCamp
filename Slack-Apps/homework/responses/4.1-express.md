# ⚡️Express

This week will involve using a popular JavaScript framework called Express. Frameworks give you a fundamental structure that you can build on without starting completely from scratch. For example, Bolt is also a framework. 



## 📚Reading Up

Express is a pretty large framework, so you will need to do a little reading to understand its basic functions. Look at the Express-related sections in [this article](https://codeforgeek.com/express-nodejs-tutorial/) for some general information.

After you are done, read [this article](https://codeforgeek.com/handle-get-post-request-express-4/) on POST and GET requests. Comment one idea for a Slack app using Express and a couple of things that stood out to you or you had questions on while researching the framework. 



## 🔨Challenge

Create a post request that prints a hello message to your local host server. Create another post request that takes parameters for a book and author, then prints out a sentence using the information.

Refer to the articles above and feel free to reach out to your mentors with any questions!
