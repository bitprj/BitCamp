## Introduction to Webhooks

#### Learn about what webhooks are and how to use them in a Slack App.

Webhooks are applications that send other apps useful information. They are extremely useful and can expand your Slack apps to a new level!

Read [this article](https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/). When you're done, research a couple webhooks and comment some ideas for a Slack app using some of them. Refer to [this site](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/33-webhook-apis-assembla-mailchimp-and-podio/2013/09/04)  for some popular webhooks.

## ðŸ”¨Creating Your Own Webhook

Now it is time to create a webhook yourself! We will be using GitHub in this camp. Github is a verison control site that lets you maintain repositories of code across several iterations. It is extremely useful for both personal and proffessional projects. 

If you don't have an account already, create one at www.github.com. You will need a repository, which can be created by pressing the 'create repository' button at the top left of your dashboard:

Once you have created a repository, navigate to the settings page from the dashboard and select 'secrets'. You will need a secret in order to access the repository. Create an arbitrary secret name and value.

Next, start your Slack app and create an ExpressReceiver object. Follow these steps:

1. Call the post message for the receiver with a parameter of '/github-stars'. 
2. Run the app, making sure to connect it to an ngrok server. Then, navigate to 'webhooks' in your Github repository settings. 
3. Create a webhook and set the payload URL to be the ngrok server URL with the parameter of the ExpressReceiver at the end. 
4. Copy and paste the secret value you create into the 'Secret' field. 
5. Lastly, select individual events and choose 'starred', then press 'update'.  Check the ngrok server in your terminal to see if the webhook connected successfully.

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
