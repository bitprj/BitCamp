## Google Translate API: Calling the Translator

#### Integrating the Translator in a Slack App.

You should now return to your ```app.js``` to implement adding Cloud Translation. In the livestream, you should have noticed the Slack App response was hardcoded to a phrase like "This is Spanish" or "This is Japanese". Now, we are going to be adding the response as the actual ```translated text``` in a thread.

## Integrating the API

In the first issue (3.1), you should have already used ```.includes``` and ```.split(-)``` to find the country code of the flag and if not, created a langMap. It should have looked something like this: ```const [x, country] = langMap[reaction] ? [, reaction] : reaction.split('-');```

We also added the feature of responding to a thread but which thread you may ask? Well, we need to find that. To do so, we are going to set ```const result``` equal to ```await client.conversations.history({ Edit Here })```.

## Country Code

Now that we have the ```const country``` set to our country code, we need to find the corresponding language to our country code. To do this, we need to create a new variable that is equal to the corresponding language. To do this, we can iterate through or simply search through our langMap for the language (*remember, it has two arguments: country and language which we need to set equal to language*).

Setting our Country Code: ```const [countryCode, language] = langMap[country];```

## Finding Text to Translate

In here, we need to pass through channel, latest, inclusive, and limit. The most important values are ```latest``` which we set to ts (*remember our const reaction?*) and ```limit``` which we set to 1 (inclusive should also be true). If you are having trouble with the layout, consider looking at how we setup the previous thread function!

Previous Thread: ```await client.chat.postMessage({channel, thread_ts: ts, text: `:${reaction}: *Here is the translation of this message in ${language}:*\n ${translatedText}`,});```

This ```client.conversations.history``` is super important because we need to find the text the user wants to translate! To do so, we need to set our textToTranslate equal to ```result.messages[0] (first index message!)```. We also need to add: ```const langIsSupported = langMap[country];``` to insure our language is supported.

## Translation Callback Logic

```javascript const [x, country] = langMap[reaction] ? [, reaction] : reaction.split('-');
  
    const result = await client.conversations.history({
      channel,
      latest: ts,
      inclusive: true,
      limit: 1
    });
  
    const { text: textToTranslate } = result.messages[0];
    const langIsSupported = langMap[country];
  
    if (langIsSupported) {
      const [countryCode, language] = langMap[country];
      const [translatedText, ...y] = await translateText(textToTranslate, countryCode);
    
      await client.chat.postMessage({
        channel,
        thread_ts: ts,
        text: `:${reaction}: *Here is the translation of this message in ${language}:*\n ${translatedText}`,
      });
    }
  });
```
Your code should look something like this besides:

```const [translatedText, ...y] = await translateText(textToTranslate, countryCode);```

If you noticed here, we are actually calling the ```translateText()``` function. The translateText function takes in two parameters, the text to translate and the countryCode which corresponds to the APIs recognized languages.

To create the function, start off with this:

```javascript 
async function translateText(text, target) {
    try {
      
    } catch (e) {
      
    }
  }
```

This is a simple try and catch function. If you don't know what try and catch is, basically it processes the code in ```try()``` and if an error is found, it will return ```catch()```, it's also known as the handling of exceptions.

Inside ```try()```, we need to call the Translator object we created before by using: 

```return await translator.translate(text, target);```

This calls the translator to translate (text) = text to translate and (target) = the country code. If you saw earlier, we called the ```translateText()``` function with specific parameters being ```textToTranslate``` and ```countryCode```. 

Inside ```catch()```, we want to catch whatever errors we find so we will will simply ```console.log(e)``` with e being the error.

Congrats, you're done with Week 3! If you have any questions, reach out to your mentors.

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
