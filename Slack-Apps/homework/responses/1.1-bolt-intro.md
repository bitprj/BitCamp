Bolt JS is a framework, or a platform, for developing in JavaScript for Slack. Bolt **significantly** reduces the learning curve for Slack development by abstracting away some of the more complicated language barriers involved. In this issue, you will be familiarizing yourself with Bolt.

## üìö Reading Up

Before getting into Bolt, [read up on Slack](https://api.slack.com/start/overview) and its use cases. This will help you get a better idea of what the projects that we will use Bolt to create. After you are done reading, you can start getting more into the technical details. Read [this article](https://api.slack.com/tools/bolt) on Bolt, then go through 2 or 3 code samples of your choice. The code samples can be found at the very bottom of the article.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection

After you are done with both articles, write down three things you found interesting and would like to learn more about. Afterwards, write down three more things that you found difficult to understand.

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
