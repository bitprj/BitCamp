## Commands and Modals

#### Introduction to Commands and Modals in the Slack API.

In this issue, you will be learning about commands and modals. Commands are a shorthand way to perform an action in Slack. In order to invoke an app with a command, you just need to type '/' in a message field. Modals are another type of view that a Slack app can have. Read [this article](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals) to learn more about modals. 

Your task is to build an app that creates a modal with the command 'ticket'. When this command is invoked, a modal should pop up asking the user any question you'd like, then giving them a text field for their response. The modal should also include a submit button, which does not require a listener for now. 

> **Note**: Before you start, make sure to create your app with the scopes and events  for messaging in a channel.

## The Command Function

The first step is to invoke the ```command()``` function for your app. This will establish that the app should be accessible through typing '/'. The signature for the function is as follows:

```javascript
app.command('/ticket', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
});
```

## The Modal

When the command is invoked, a modal should pop up asking the question. Since there are often errors with views, make sure to wrap this section of your code in a try-catch statement. Next, create a variable that opens a view once the command has been invoked:

```javascript
app.command('/ticket', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
  // Acknowledge the command request
  await ack();

  try {
    // Call views.open with the built-in client
    const result = await client.views.open({
    });
  }
   catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
```

Within the ```views.open()``` function, you will need to specify its trigger id, and then create a view object of type modal:

```javascript
const result = await client.views.open({
      // Pass a valid trigger_id within 3 seconds of receiving it
      trigger_id: body.trigger_id,
      // View payload
      view: {
        type: 'modal',
      }
});
```

Afterwards, you will need to give the modal a callback-id and a title:

```javascript
const result = await client.views.open({
      // Pass a valid trigger_id within 3 seconds of receiving it
      trigger_id: body.trigger_id,
      // View payload
      view: {
        type: 'modal',
        // View identifier
        callback_id: 'view_1',
        title: {
          type: 'plain_text',
          text: 'Modal title'
        },
});
```

From there, you technically have a working modal! However, you will still need to add a button, a question, and a text field. This will require a block, which you used in a previous issue. The block will be the next part of the modal. 

```javascript
blocks: [
          {
            type: 'section',
            text: {
              type: 'mrkdwn',
              text: 'Welcome to a modal with _blocks_'
            },
            accessory: {
              type: 'button',
              text: {
                type: 'plain_text',
                text: 'Click me!'
              },
              action_id: 'button_abc'
            }
          },
          {
            type: 'input',
            block_id: 'input_c',
            label: {
              type: 'plain_text',
              text: 'What are your hopes and dreams?'
            },
            element: {
              type: 'plain_text_input',
              action_id: 'dreamy_input',
              multiline: true
            }
          }
        ]
```

 Now your modal has the perfect interface! All that is left to do is create a submit button for the actual modal. This is done outside of the block kit since it is a property that all views have.

```javascript
 submit: {
          type: 'plain_text',
          text: 'Submit'
        }
```



Refer to the following template for building a command:

```javascript
// Listen for a slash command invocation
app.command('/<name of command>', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
  // Acknowledge the command request
  await ack();

  try {
    // Call views.open with the built-in client
    const result = await client.views.open({
      // Pass a valid trigger_id within 3 seconds of receiving it
      trigger_id: body.trigger_id,
      // View payload
      view: {
        type: '<type_of_view>',
        // View identifier
        callback_id: 'view_1',
        title: {
          type: 'plain_text',
          text: '<title>'
        },
        submit: {
          type: 'plain_text',
          text: 'Submit'
        }
      }
    });
    console.log(result);
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
});

```

Test your app to make sure it works. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to either of your mentors!

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
