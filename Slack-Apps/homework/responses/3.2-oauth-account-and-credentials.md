## Google Translate API: Account & Credentials

#### Setting up a Google Developer Account and using the Translator.

After setting up our event listener and making our Slack App respond in a thread, it's finally time to to integrate the Google Translate API.  Before we install the client libary and actually create the translation callback logic for our Slack App, we need to create an account and find our downloaded API token.

## Creating an Account

To create a Google Developer Account, head to: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/ and click on ```Get Started for Free```. Select your ```Country``` and accept the ```Terms of Service```, then press Continue. Next, fill out the assigned textboxes and add a payment *Note: you won't be charged unless you specfically add $ to your account, all free-trial accounts comes with 300$ of credit*.

## New Project

You should now be on the dashboard and your Google Developer Account is fully created. Cloud Translation, has two editions, a basic and advanced version. For our needs, choose the basic version (in the future, if you want to use the Google Translate API for more advanced options, you could use the advanced edition). 

Then, click on the button labelled ```Create a New Project```. To use services provided by Google Cloud, you must create a project. A project organizes all your Google Cloud resources. A project consists of a set of collaborators, enabled APIs (and other resources), monitoring tools, billing information, and authentication and access controls ([here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?_ga=2.121428744.1276828874.1608494305-719014461.1607485253 "here")). Fill out the fields and continue.

## Free Trial and Billing

You should now be at a screen asking you to enable billing for your new project. Although it asks you to enable billing, we are using the Google Developer Account (Free Trial) which gives you 300$ of credit to test and use Cloud Translation.

If you are having trouble with enabling the API, check this link: https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable.

## Service Account Keys

When an identity calls an API, Google Cloud requires that the identity has the appropriate permissions. You can grant permissions by granting roles to a service account. To do this, we need to create and locate ```Service Keys```. Follow these steps:

1. Go to ```Create Service Account Key``` page ([here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?_ga=2.193314605.1276828874.1608494305-719014461.1607485253 "here")).
2. From the Service account list, select New service account.
3. In the service account name field, enter a name and set the role as ```Project Owner```.
4. Then click ```Create```, you should download a JSON file that contains your key downloads.

## Providing OAUTH to Environment

Provide authentication credentials to your application code by setting the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS. Replace [PATH] with the file path of the JSON file that contains your service account key. This variable only applies to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again.

Linux or macOS: ```export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"```
Windows: ```$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"```

## Installing Client Libraries

We're almost done! Lastly, we need to install the library by using ```npm install --save @google-cloud/translate``` in your NODEJS terminal. You should now have a new folder called ```node_modules```.

You also need to create a new ```Translator``` by using the following:

Library: ```const { v2: { Translate } } = require('@google-cloud/translate');```
Translator Object: ```const translator = new Translate();```

If you have any questions, please reach out to your mentors or read the documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup "here").

**After you have finished, make sure to commit any file changes you made. To do this, please create a `branch` off of the master called `week(x)` with x being the # of the week you are on. For that week you will need to create a PR for every Learning Lab step to review and make sure your work is correct. For example: After finishing step 1.2, make a new branch off of `week(x)` and call it `week(x)-1.2` (with 1.2 being the step you're on). Then create a `Pull Request` between `week(x)` and `week(x)-1.2`. After reviewing you're PR or having another user review it, merge you're work and continue.**

**REMINDER: If you are part of the MENTORED group, after you complete all steps within a certain week and followed the instructions above, create a `Pull Request` with your work from `week(x)` to `master` and assign your mentor as a reviewer. If you are an open-source user, do the same but self-review your PR to continue to the next week.**
