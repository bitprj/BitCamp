In the Livestream Portion of Week 3, students will be introduced to third party API integration. This week, students will start off by using the Google Translate API. Students will first learn a few more actions including how to respond to emoji reactions and how to set Slack Apps to reply to a thread. Using these actions, students will create a Slack App that responds to a flag (emoji reaction) and posts a message in a thread with the language of given flag. The livestream for this week will hardcode the callback response to prepare students to integrate the API for homework.
