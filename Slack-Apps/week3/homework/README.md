### Homework
In the Homework Portion of Week 3, students will continue to advance the skills taught during the livestream through a guided Github Learning Lab. Students will begin the process of integrating the google translate API (found [here](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/ "here")) by learning how to create an account, obtain an API key/token, and finally, code the callback logic that sends a message and recieves a translated response back. Students will create an app, building on to the livestream, that responds to a flag (emoji reaction) + phrase and will return the translated phrase in a thread.
