# **Week 3: Integration with Google Translate API**

### Livestream

In the Livestream Portion of Week 3, students will be introduced to third party API integration. This week, students will start off by using the Google Translate API. Students will first learn a few more actions including how to respond to emoji reactions and how to set Slack Apps to reply to a thread. Using these actions, students will create a Slack App that responds to a flag (emoji reaction) and posts a message in a thread with the language of given flag. The livestream for this week will hardcode the callback response to prepare students to integrate the API for homework.

### Homework

In the Homework Portion of Week 3, students will continue to advance the skills taught during the livestream through a guided Github Learning Lab. Students will begin the process of integrating the google translate API (found [here](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/ "here")) by learning how to create an account, obtain an API key/token, and finally, code the callback logic that sends a message and recieves a translated response back. Students will create an app, building on to the livestream, that responds to a flag (emoji reaction) + phrase and will return the translated phrase in a thread.
