### Livestream

In the Livestream Portion of Week 1, students will be introduced to the basics of the Slack API, including what a slack app is, how it is used in the industry, and the basics of creating their first app. During the livestream for this week, topics such as the Bolt Framework ([here](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started "Bolt Framework")), Node JS, permissions/scopes, and a brief introduction of events and listeners will be discussed. As well, a basic slack app will be created that simply listens to a message in a specific channel, and responds to the user with a given message.
