# Week 1 Livestream

Welcome to your first livestream of Bitcamp Slack! In week 1, we are going to be going over the basics of navigating the Slack API, using the Bolt Framework, and setting up a coding environment for NodeJS.

## üìù Objectives

### Week 1 Objectives

This week's goals include:

- Understanding the basics of the Slack API
- Learning how to use the Bolt Framework in NodeJS
- Setting up a coding environment (an IDE/compiler)

### Livestream Objectives

The livestream for Week 1 is an introduction to the week's objectives. During the livestream, you will learn how to navigate, understand, and use the Slack API documentation. As well, how to use the Bolt Framework to create Slack Apps and lastly, how to setup a working environment to create your own Slack Apps and how to run them on your own computer.

The livestream will be based on introductory information needed to understand more complex ideas that will be introduced in later weeks. This week will focus on the ability to understand the concepts of what a Slack App is, how it is built, and how it is ran (from your home computer).

## What is a Slack App? üì≤

First of all, if you haven't used Slack yet (which you probably have), Slack is a workplace communication tool/platform, ‚Äúa single place for messaging, tools and files.‚Äù This means Slack is an instant messaging system with lots of add-ins for other workplace tools. The add-ins aren‚Äôt necessary to use Slack, though, because the main functionality is all about talking to other people. There are two methods of chat in Slack: channels (group chat), and direct message or DM (person-to-person chat).

Within Slack, you have Slack Apps! Slack Apps can be compared to extensions that help you in your day to day process. For example, some of the most known Slack Apps include Google Calendar Events, Polly, and Paymo (for a complete list, if you're interested: https://www.paymoapp.com/blog/best-slack-apps/). Slack Apps allow you to make your own Slack Workspace more complete through Slack Apps that help you with your work, communication, and efficency. Also, they can really make your workspace more lively!

## What is Bolt? ‚ö°

Bolt is a framework that lets you build Slack apps in a flash. Bolt handles much of the foundational setup so you can focus on your app's functionality. By default, Bolt includes token validation and server support, a simplified OAuth interface, and automatic retry and rate-limiting logic.

Although Bolt will also be covered in the homework (as it is SUPER IMPORTANT for understand how to make a Slack App), the best way to learn is trying it out yourself: https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-js.

## Setting Up an IDE üíª

What is an IDE vs. a compiler? Well think about it like this, an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, contains not only a compiler but many other features that make the process of creating code much easier because of these said features that assist you. 

IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

Some of these features include: editing source code, syntax highlighting, and autocomplete. One of the most well-known IDEs is **Visual Studio Code** created by Microsoft. Feel free to use an IDE of your choice but make sure it has compatibility for NodeJS. If you want to install VSC, follow the steps below:

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and select what operating system you have (mac, windows, etc).

2. Open the installer (.msi or .exe) and continue until VSC starts downloading. Once downloaded, open it up and watch this video on how to navigate around: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ.

3. To install NodeJS (for Slack Apps), head to: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the LTS version.

4. Once installed, if you're on Windows, you're all set and ready to code! If you're on linux or macOS, make sure to add NodeJS to path just in case you have the setting to do so off in the installer: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_environment_setup.htm.

Congrats! You now have a working IDE and are ready to create your first Slack App. If you need any help, make sure to reach out to your student mentors or checkout the links below:

## Demo Slack App!

Mentors will livestream themselves creating a Slack App for the students to understand the different components of creating one. If you want to follow along, the tutorial is posted here: https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started.
