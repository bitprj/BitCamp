# **Week 1: Getting Started with the Slack API**

ðŸ“š **Summary**

Students will be learning the basic of Slack API including the introductions of Node Java Script, Permission/Scopes and a brief introduction of Events and Listeners. Students will later browse the slack API documentation which they are going use to complete their final assignment. 

**Learning Objectives**
- Introduction to Slack API.
- Intro to Node JS, Permission/Scopes, Events And Listeners.
- Creating a slack app that listens and responds to a specific channel.

### Livestream

In the Livestream Portion of Week 1, students will be introduced to the basics of the Slack API, including what a slack app is, how it is used in the industry, and the basics of creating their first app. During the livestream for this week, topics such as the Bolt Framework ([here](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started "Bolt Framework")), Node JS, permissions/scopes, and a brief introduction of events and listeners will be discussed. As well, a basic slack app will be created that simply listens to a message in a specific channel, and responds to the user with a given message.

### Homework

In the Homework Portion of Week 1, students will continue to advance the skills taught during the livestream through a guided Github Learning Lab. Students will browse the Slack API documentation, experiment with events and listeners, assign permissions/scopes, and further learn response functions like message() and say(). Doing so, they will have a final assignment of creating a similar slack app (to the livestream) that responds to an event rather than a message.

During the Livestream students will be able to ask questions refering to the current task or to the homework. This will allow students to be able to finish their final assignment while browsing through the API documentation and through a guided Github Learning Lab.
