###  **Week 1: Getting Started with Slack API**
***

### Livestream

In the Livestream Portion of Week 1, students will be introduced to the basics of the Slack API, including what a slack app is, how it is used in the industry, and the basics of creating their first app. During the livestream for this week, topics such as the Bolt Framework ([here](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started "Bolt Framework")), Node JS, permissions/scopes, and a brief introduction of events and listeners will be discussed. As well, a basic slack app will be created that simply listens to a message in a specific channel, and responds to the user with a given message.

### Homework

In the Homework Portion of Week 1, students will continue to advance the skills taught during the livestream through a guided Github Learning Lab. Students will browse the Slack API documentation, experiment with events and listeners, assign permissions/scopes, and further learn response functions like message() and say(). Doing so, they will have a final assignment of creating a similar slack app (to the livestream) that responds to an event rather than a message.

**Learning Objectives**

- Introduction to the Slack API (https://api.slack.com).
- Using Bolt Framework with NodeJS (https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js).
- Creating a Slack App that uses `say()` and responds to a message.

###  ‚ùì How will this help students?

In Week 1, students will work towards the end goal of creating their first Slack App by being introduced to the skills necessary to create one (reading documentation, learning about NodeJS, etc). During the Livestream, students will be able to ask questions refering to their current task.
