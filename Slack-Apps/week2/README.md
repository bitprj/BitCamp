### **Week 2: Introduction to Shortcuts, Modals, and BlockKit**
***

### Livestream

In the Livestream Portion of Week 2, students will work with new topics like shortcuts, modals, and BlockKit. Students will use skills from the previous week such as scopes/permissions and listeners to further progress their understanding. During the livestream for this week, students will build a polling Slack App using a shortcut-triggered modal (using a shortcut listener and poll shortcut from [api.slack.com](http//api.slack.com "Slack API")), BlockKit to accept user input/view building, and a ViewSubmission listener to post the poll and receive emoji responses.

### Homework

In the Homework Portion of Week 2, students will continue to advance the skills taught during the livestream through a guided Github Learning Lab. Students will focus on BlockKit (found [here](https://api.slack.com/block-kit "here")) and explore the UI framework by creating more complicated messages that change and work with user input. As well, students will strengthen their understanding of modals by experimenting with different modal blocks and views. At the end of the week, students will be tasked to create a simple Slack App that uses the skills learned in week 2 (shortcuts, modals, and BlockKit) in a creative way to recieve and respond to user input.

**Learning Objectives**

- Introduction to BlockKit (https://api.slack.com/block-kit).
- Using Modals & Views (https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals).
- Creating a Polling Slack App that uses a `view` and a `modal`.

###  ‚ùì How will this help students?

In Week 2, students will work on developing skills they worked on in the previous week and learn about new functions of the Slack API like BlockKit, Modals, and Views. During the Livestream, students will be able to ask questions refering to their current task.
