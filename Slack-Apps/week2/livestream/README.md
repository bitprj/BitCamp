### Livestream

In the Livestream Portion of Week 2, students will work with new topics like shortcuts, modals, and BlockKit. Students will use skills from the previous week such as scopes/permissions and listeners to further progress their understanding. During the livestream for this week, students will build a polling Slack App using a shortcut-triggered modal (using a shortcut listener and poll shortcut from [api.slack.com](http//api.slack.com "Slack API")), BlockKit to accept user input/view building, and a ViewSubmission listener to post the poll and receive emoji responses.
